<p>We two&mdash;the author and his illustrator&mdash;did not know what
we had done until the newspapers told us. But the press has
explained it in the following poised and consistent criticism:</p>

<p>&#8220;Too many suggestions of profanity.&#8221;<br />

<span style="padding-left: 5em">&mdash;<i>Zion&#8217;s Herald</i>, Boston, 21 Dec. &#8217;92.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Some excellent moral lessons.&#8221;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 5em">&mdash;<i>Citizen</i>, Brooklyn, 27 Nov. &#8217;92.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;If it has any lesson to teach, we have been unable to find
it.&#8221;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 5em">&mdash;<i>Independent</i>, New York, 10 Nov. &#8217;92.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The story is a familiar one.&#8221;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 5em">&mdash;<i>Detroit Free Press</i>, 28 Nov. &#8217;92.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Refreshingly novel.&#8221;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 5em">&mdash;<i>Cincinnati Commercial Gazette</i>, 17 Dec. &#8217;92.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;It is a burlesque.&#8221;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 5em">&mdash;<i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, Dec. &#8217;92.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;All those who love lessons drawn from life will enjoy this
book.&#8221;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 5em">&mdash;<i>Christian Advocate</i>, Cincinnati, 2 Nov. &#8217;92.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The style of this production is difficult to define.&#8221;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 5em">&mdash;<i>Court Journal</i>, London, 26 Nov. &#8217;92.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;One wonders why writer and artist should put so much
labor on a production which seems to have so little reason
for existence.&#8221;<br />

<p>Now the public knows exactly what sort of book this is,
and we cannot be held responsible.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 7em; text-indent: 0em"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">here</span> was something
wrong in the cellar at
Wantley Manor. Little
Whelpdale knew it, for
he was Buttons, and
Buttons always knows
what is being done with
the wine, though he may look as if he did not.
And old Popham knew it, too. He was Butler,
and responsible to Sir Godfrey for all the brandy,
and ale, and cider, and mead, and canary, and
other strong waters there were in the house.</p>

<p>Now, Sir Godfrey Disseisin, fourth Baron of
Wantley, and immediate tenant by knight-service
to His Majesty King John of England, was particular
about his dogs, and particular about his
horses, and about his only daughter and his boy
Roland, and had been very particular indeed
about his wife, who, I am sorry to say, did not
live long. But all this was nothing to the fuss
he made about his wine. When the claret was
not warm enough, or the Moselle wine was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
cool enough, you could hear him roaring all over
the house; for, though generous in heart and a
staunch Churchman, he was immoderately choleric.
Very often, when Sir Godfrey fell into
one of his rages at dinner, old Popham, standing
behind his chair, trembled so violently that his
calves would shake loose, thus obliging him to
hasten behind the tall leathern screen at the head
of the banquet-hall and readjust them.</p>


<p>Twice in each year the Baron sailed over to
France, where he visited the wine-merchants,
and tasted samples of all new vintages,&mdash;though
they frequently gave him unmentionable aches.
Then, when he was satisfied that he had selected
the soundest and richest, he returned to Wantley
Manor, bringing home wooden casks that were
as big as hay-stacks, and so full they could not
gurgle when you tipped them. Upon arriving,
he sent for Mrs. Mistletoe, the family governess
and (for economy&#8217;s sake) housekeeper, who knew
how to write,&mdash;something the Baron&#8217;s father and
mother had never taught him when he was a
little boy, because they didn&#8217;t know how themselves,
and despised people who did,&mdash;and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Mrs. Mistletoe had cut neat pieces of card-board
for labels and got ready her goose-quill, Sir Godfrey
would say, &#8220;Write, Ch&acirc;teau Lafitte, 1187;&#8221;
or, &#8220;Write, Chambertin, 1203.&#8221; (Those, you
know, were the names and dates of the vintages.)
&#8220;Yes, my lord,&#8221; Mistletoe always piped up; on
which Sir Godfrey would peer over her shoulder
at the writing, and mutter, &#8220;Hum; yes, that&#8217;s
correct,&#8221; just as if he knew how to read, the old
humbug! Then Mistletoe, who was a silly girl
and had lost her husband early, would go &#8220;Tee-hee,
Sir Godfrey!&#8221; as the gallant gentleman
gave her a kiss. Of course, this was not just
what he should have done; but he was a widower,
you must remember, and besides that, as
the years went on this little ceremony ceased to
be kept up. When it was &#8220;Ch&acirc;teau Lafitte,
1187,&#8221; kissing Mistletoe was one thing; but
when it came to &#8220;Chambertin, 1203,&#8221; the lady
weighed two hundred and twenty-five pounds,
and wore a wig.</p>
</div>

<p>But, wig and all, Mistletoe had a high position
in Wantley Manor. The household was conducted
on strictly feudal principles. Nobody,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
except the members of the family, received
higher consideration than did the old Governess.
She and the Chaplain were on a level, socially,
and they sat at the same table with the Baron.
That drew the line. Old Popham the Butler
might tell little Whelpdale as often as he pleased
that he was just as good as Mistletoe; but he
had to pour out Mistletoe&#8217;s wine for her, notwithstanding.
If she scolded him (which she
always did if Sir Godfrey had been scolding
her), do you suppose he dared to answer back?
Gracious, no! He merely kicked the two head-footmen,
Meeson and Welsby, and spoke severely
to the nine house-maids. Meeson and
Welsby then made life a painful thing for the
five under-footmen and the grooms, while the
nine house-maids boxed the ears of Whelpdale
the Buttons, and Whelpdale the Buttons punched
the scullion&#8217;s eye. As for the scullion, he was
bottom of the list; but he could always relieve
his feelings by secretly pulling the tails of Sir
Godfrey&#8217;s two tame ravens, whose names were
Croak James and Croak Elizabeth. I never
knew what these birds did at that; but something,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
you may be sure. So you see that I was
right when I said the household was conducted
on strictly feudal principles. The Cook had a
special jurisdiction of her own, and everybody
was more or less afraid of her.</p>

<p>Whenever Sir Godfrey had come home with
new wine, and after the labels had been pasted
on the casks, then Popham, with Whelpdale
beside him, had these carefully set down in the
cellar, which was a vast dim room, the ceilings
supported by heavy arches; the barrels, bins,
kegs, hogsheads, tuns, and demijohns of every
size and shape standing like forests and piled to
the ceiling. And now something was wrong
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;This &#8217;ere&#8217;s a hawful succumstence, sir,&#8221; observed
Whelpdale the Buttons to his superior,
respectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, indeed, a himbroglio,&#8221; replied Popham,
who had a wide command of words, and
knew it.</p>

<p>Neither domestic spoke again for some time.
They were seated in the buttery. The Butler
crossed his right leg over his left, and waved the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
suspended foot up and down,&mdash;something he
seldom did unless very grievously perturbed.
As for poor little Whelpdale, he mopped his
brow with the napkins that were in a basket
waiting for the wash.</p>

<p>Then the bell rang.</p>

<p>&#8220;His ludship&#8217;s study-bell,&#8221; said Popham.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t keep him waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better apprise his ludship of the
facks?&#8221; asked Whelpdale, in a weak voice.</p>

<p>Popham made no reply. He arose and briefly
kicked Buttons out of the buttery. Then he
mounted a chair to listen better. &#8220;He has
hentered his ludship&#8217;s apawtment,&#8221; he remarked,
hearing the sound of voices come faintly down
the little private staircase that led from Sir Godfrey&#8217;s
study to the buttery: the Baron was in the
habit of coming down at night for crackers and
cheese before he went to bed. Presently one
voice grew much louder than the other. It
questioned. There came a sort of whining in
answer. Then came a terrific stamp on the
ceiling and a loud &#8220;Go on, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, now, now!&#8221; thought Popham.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Do you want to hear at once, without waiting
any longer, what little Whelpdale is telling Sir
Godfrey? Well, you must know that for the past
thirteen years, ever since 1190, the neighbourhood
had been scourged by a terrible Dragon.
The monster was covered with scales, and had a
long tail and huge unnatural wings, beside fearful
jaws that poured out smoke and flame whenever
they opened. He always came at dead of
night, roaring, bellowing, and sparkling and
flaming over the hills, and horrid claps of thunder
were very likely to attend his progress.
Concerning the nature and quality of his roaring,
the honest copyholders of Wantley could never
agree, although every human being had heard
him hundreds of times. Some said it was like
a mad bull, only much louder and worse. Old
Gaffer Piers the ploughman swore that if his
tomcat weighed a thousand pounds it would
make a noise almost as bad as that on summer
nights, with the moon at the full and other cats
handy. But farmer Stiles said, &#8220;Nay, &#8217;tis like
none of your bulls nor cats. But when I have
come home too near the next morning, my wife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
can make me think of this Dragon as soon as
ever her mouth be open.&#8221;</p>


<div class="backright" style="background-image: url(images/illo_png029.jpg); height: 100%; padding-right: 0.5em">

<div class="sandbag-right" style="width:200px; height:239px;"> </div>
<div class="sandbag-right" style="width:320px; height:45px;"> </div>

<p>This shows you that there were divers opinions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
If you were not afraid to look out of the
window about midnight, you could see the sky
begin to look red in the quarter from which he
was approaching, just as it glares when some
distant house is on fire. But you must shut the
window and hide before he came over the hill;
for very few that had looked upon the Dragon
ever lived to that day twelvemonth. This monster
devoured the substance of the tenantry and
yeomen. When their fields of grain were golden
for the harvest, in a single night he cut them
down and left their acres blasted by his deadly
fire. He ate the cows, the sheep, the poultry,
and at times even sucked eggs. Many pious
saints had visited the district, but not one had
been able by his virtue to expel the Dragon;
and the farmers and country folk used to repeat
a legend that said the Dragon was a punishment
for the great wickedness of the Baron&#8217;s
ancestor, the original Sir Godfrey Disseisin, who,
when summoned on the first Crusade to Palestine,
had entirely refused to go and help his
cousin Godfrey de Bouillon wrest the Holy Sepulchre
from the Paynim. The Baron&#8217;s ancestor,
when a stout young lad, had come over with
William the Conqueror; and you must know
that to have an ancestor who had come over
with William the Conqueror was in those old
days a much rarer thing than it is now, and
any one who could boast of it was held in
high esteem by
his neighbours,
who
asked him to
dinner and left
their cards upon
him continually.
But the first
Sir Godfrey
thought one
conquest was
enough for any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
man; and in reply to his cousin&#8217;s invitation to
try a second, answered in his blunt Norman
French, &#8220;Nul tiel verte dedans ceot oyle,&#8221;
which displeased the Church, and ended forever
all relations between the families. The
Dragon did not come at once, for this gentleman&#8217;s
son, the grandfather of our Sir Godfrey, as
soon as he was twenty-one, went off to the Holy
Land himself, fought very valiantly, and was
killed, leaving behind him at Wantley an inconsolable
little wife and an heir six months old.
This somewhat appeased the Pope; but the present
Sir Godfrey, when asked to accompany King
Richard Lion Heart on his campaign against the
Infidel, did not avail himself of the opportunity to
set the family right in the matter of Crusades.
This hereditary impiety, which the Pope did not
consider at all mended by the Baron&#8217;s most regular
attendance at the parish church on all Sundays,
feast days, fast days, high days, low days,
saints&#8217; days, vigils, and octaves, nor by his paying
his tithes punctually to Father Anselm, Abbot of
Oyster-le-Main (a wonderful person, of whom I
shall have a great deal to tell you presently), this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
impiety, I say, finished the good standing of the
House of Wantley. Rome frowned, the earth
trembled, and the Dragon came. And (the legend
went on to say) this curse would not be
removed until a female lineal descendant of the
first Sir Godfrey, a young lady who had never
been married, and had never loved anybody except
her father and mother and her sisters and
brothers, should go out in the middle of the night
on Christmas Eve, all by herself, and encounter
the Dragon single handed.</p>

<p>Now, of course, this is not what little Whelpdale
is trying to tell the Baron up in the study;
for everybody in Wantley knew all about the
legend except one person, and that was Miss
Elaine, Sir Godfrey&#8217;s only daughter, eighteen
years old at the last Court of Piepoudre, when
her father (after paying all the farmers for all the
cows and sheep they told him had been eaten
by the Dragon since the last Court) had made
his customary proclamation, to wit: his good-will
and protection to all his tenantry; and if any
man, woman, child, or other person, caused his
daughter, Miss Elaine, to hear anything about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the legend, such tale-bearer should be chained
to a tree, and kept fat until the Dragon found
him and ate him. So everybody obligingly kept
the Baron&#8217;s secret.</p>
</div>

<p>Sir Godfrey is just this day returned from
France with some famous tuns of wine, and
presents for Elaine and Mrs. Mistletoe. His
humour is (or was, till Whelpdale, poor wretch!
answered the bell) of the best possible. And
now, this moment, he is being told by the luckless
Buttons that the Dragon of Wantley has
taken to drinking, as well as eating, what does
not belong to him; has for the last three nights
burst the big gates of the wine-cellar that open
on the hillside the Manor stands upon; that a
hogshead of the Baron&#8217;s best Burgundy is going;
and that two hogsheads of his choicest Malvoisie
are gone!</p>

<p>One hundred and twenty-eight gallons in three
nights&#8217; work! But I suppose a fire-breathing
Dragon must be very thirsty.</p>

<p>There was a dead silence in the study overhead,
and old Popham&#8217;s calves were shaking
loose as he waited.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;And so you stood by and let this black,
sneaking, prowling, thieving&#8221; (here the Baron
used some shocking expressions which I shall not
set down) &#8220;Dragon swill my wine?&#8221;</p>

<div class="backleft" style="background-image: url(images/illo_png034.jpg); height: 100%;"><a name="baron" id="baron"></a>

<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:184px; height:365px;"> </div>

<p style="padding-top: 2.5em">&#8220;St&mdash;st&mdash;stood by, your ludship?&#8221; said little
Whelpdale. &#8220;No, sir; no one didn&#8217;t do any
standing by, sir. He roared that terrible, sir,
we was all under the bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, by my coat of mail and great right
leg!&#8221; shouted Sir Godfrey. The quaking Popham
heard no more. The door of the private
staircase flew open with a loud noise, and down
came little Whelpdale head over heels into the
buttery. After him strode Sir Godfrey in full
mail armour, clashing his steel fists against the
banisters. The nose-piece of his helmet was
pushed up to allow him to speak plainly,&mdash;and
most plainly did he speak, I can assure you, all
the way down stairs, keeping his right eye glaring
upon Popham in one corner of the buttery,
and at the same time petrifying Whelpdale
with his left. From father to son, the Disseisins
had always been famous for the manner
in which they could straddle their eyes; and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Sir Godfrey the
family trait was
very strongly
marked.</p>

<p>Arrived at the
bottom, he stopped
for a moment to
throw a ham
through the stained-glass
window, and
then made straight
for Popham. But
the head Butler was
an old family servant,
and had learned to know his place.</p>

<p>With surprising agility he hopped on a table,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
so that Sir Godfrey&#8217;s foot flew past its destined
goal and caught a shelf that was loaded
with a good deal of his wedding china. The
Baron was far too dignified a person to take
any notice of this mishap, and he simply
strode on, out of the buttery, and so through
the halls of the Manor, where all who caught
even the most distant sight of his coming,
promptly withdrew into the privacy of their
apartments.</p>

rage mounting as he
went, till presently he
began talking aloud to
himself. &#8220;Mort d&#8217;aieul
and Cosenage!&#8221; he muttered, grinding his teeth
over these oaths; &#8220;matters have come to a
pretty pass, per my and per tout! And this is
what my wine-bibbing ancestor has brought on
his posterity by his omission to fight for the True
Faith!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey knew the outrageous injustice of
this remark as well as you or I do; and so did
the portrait of his ancestor, which he happened
to be passing under, for the red nose in the
tapestry turned a deeper ruby in scornful anger.
But, luckily for the nerves of its descendant, the
moths had eaten its mouth away so entirely, that
the retort it attempted to make sounded only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
like a faint hiss, which the Baron mistook for a
little gust of wind behind the arras.</p>

<p>&#8220;My ruddy Burgundy!&#8221; he groaned, &#8220;going,
going! and my rich, fruity Malvoisie,&mdash;all gone!
Father Anselm didn&#8217;t appreciate it, either, that
night he dined here last September. He said I
had put egg-shells in it. Egg-shells! Pooh! As
if any parson could talk about wine. These
Church folk had better mind their business, and
say grace, and eat their dinner, and be thankful.
That&#8217;s what I say. Egg-shells, forsooth!&#8221; The
Baron was passing through the chapel, and he
mechanically removed his helmet; but he did not
catch sight of the glittering eye of Father Anselm
himself, who had stepped quickly into the confessional,
and there in the dark watched Sir Godfrey
with a strange, mocking smile. When he
had the chapel to himself again, the tall gray
figure of the Abbot appeared in full view, and
craftily moved across the place. If you had been
close beside him, and had listened hard, you
could have heard a faint clank and jingle beneath
his gown as he moved, which would have struck
you as not the sort of noise a hair-shirt ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
make. But I am glad you were not there; for I
do not like the way the Abbot looked at all, especially
so near Christmas-tide, when almost
every one somehow looks kinder as he goes
about in the world. Father Anselm moved out
of the chapel, and passed through lonely corridors
out of Wantley Manor, out of the court-yard,
and so took his way to Oyster-le-Main in
the gathering dusk. The few people who met
him received his blessing, and asked no questions;
for they were all serfs of the glebe, and
well used to meeting the Abbot going and
coming near Wantley Manor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sir Godfrey paced along. &#8220;To
think,&#8221; he continued, aloud, &#8220;to think the country
could be rid of this monster, this guzzling serpent,
in a few days! Plenty would reign again.
Public peace of mind would be restored. The
cattle would increase, the crops would grow, my
rents treble, and my wines be drunk no more
by a miserable, ignorant&mdash;but, no! I&#8217;m her
father. Elaine shall never be permitted to sacrifice
herself for one dragon, or twenty dragons,
either.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter, papa?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey started. There was Miss Elaine
in front of him; and she had put on one of the
new French gowns he had brought over with
him.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Matter? Plenty of matter!&#8221; he began, unluckily.
&#8220;At least, nothing is the matter at all,
my dear. What a question! Am I not back all
safe from the sea? Nothing is the matter, of
course! Hasn&#8217;t your old father been away from
you two whole months? And weren&#8217;t those
pretty dresses he has carried back with him for
his little girl? And isn&#8217;t the wine&mdash;Zounds, no,
the wine isn&#8217;t&mdash;at least, certainly it is&mdash;to be sure
it&#8217;s what it ought to be&mdash;<i>what</i> it ought to be?
Yes! But, Mort d&#8217;aieul! not <i>where</i> it ought to
be! Hum! hum! I think I am going mad!&#8221;
And Sir Godfrey, forgetting he held the helmet
all this while, dashed his hands to his head with
such violence that the steel edge struck hard
above the ear, and in one minute had raised a
lump there as large as the egg of a fowl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor, poor papa,&#8221; said Miss Elaine. And
she ran and fetched some cold water, and, dipping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
her dainty lace handkerchief into it, she bathed
the Baron&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, my child,&#8221; he murmured, presently.
&#8220;Of course, nothing is the matter. They
were very slow in putting the new&#8221; (here he
gave a gulp) &#8220;casks of wine into the cellar;
that&#8217;s all. &#8217;Twill soon be dinner-time. I must
make me ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so saying, the Baron kissed his daughter
and strode away towards his dressing-room. But
she heard him shout &#8220;Mort d&#8217;aieul!&#8221; more than
once before he was out of hearing. Then his
dressing-room door shut with a bang, and sent
echoes all along the entries above and below.</p>

<p>The December
night
was coming
down, and a
little twinkling
lamp
hung at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
end of the passage. Towards this Miss Elaine
musingly turned her steps, still squeezing her
now nearly dry handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he mean?&#8221; she said to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Elaine!&#8221; shouted Sir Godfrey, away off round
a corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, papa, I&#8217;m coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come. I&#8217;m going to the bath. A&mdash;did
you hear me say anything particular?&#8221;</p>

<p style="padding-top: 0.5em">&#8220;Do you mean when I met you?&#8221; answered
Elaine. &#8220;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;that is,&mdash;not exactly,
papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t dare to ask me any questions,
for I won&#8217;t have it.&#8221; And another door slammed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did papa mean?&#8221; said Miss Elaine,
once more.</p>

<p>Her bright brown eyes were looking at the
floor as she walked slowly on towards the light, and
her lips, which had been a little open so that you
could have seen what dainty teeth she had, shut
quite close. In fact, she was thinking, which was
something you could seldom accuse her of. I do
not know exactly what her thoughts were, except
that the words &#8220;dragon&#8221; and &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
bumping against each other in them continually;
and whenever they bumped, Miss Elaine frowned
a little deeper, till she really looked almost
solemn. In this way she came under the hanging
lamp and entered the door in front of which
it shone.</p>

<p>This was the ladies&#8217; library, full of the most
touching romances about Roland, and Walter of
Aquitaine, and Sir Tristram, and a great number
of other excitable young fellows, whose behaviour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
had invariably got them into dreadful difficulties,
but had as invariably made them, in the eyes of
every damsel they saw, the most attractive, fascinating,
sweet, dear creatures in the world.
Nobody ever read any of these books except
Mrs. Mistletoe and the family Chaplain. These
two were, indeed, the only people in the household
that knew how to read,&mdash;which may account
for it in some measure. It was here that Miss
Elaine came in while she was thinking so hard,
and found old Mistletoe huddled to the fire.
She had been secretly reading the first chapters
of a new and pungent French romance, called
&#8220;Roger and Angelica,&#8221; that was being published
in a Paris and a London magazine simultaneously.
Only thus could the talented French
author secure payment for his books in England;
for King John, who had recently murdered his
little nephew Arthur, had now turned his attention
to obstructing all arrangements for an international
copyright. In many respects, this monarch
was no credit to his family.</p>

alt="Mistletoe consults her cookbook" title="Mistletoe consults her cookbook" /></a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>


<p>When the Governess heard Miss Elaine open
the door behind her, she thought it was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
family Chaplain, and, quickly throwing the shocking
story on the floor, she opened the household
cookery-book,&mdash;an enormous volume many feet
square, suspended from the ceiling by strong
chains, and containing several thousand receipts
for English, French, Italian, Croatian, Dalmatian,
and Acarnanian dishes, beginning with a poem
in blank verse written to his confectioner by the
Emperor Charles the Fat. German cooking was
omitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking up a new plum-pudding for
Christmas,&#8221; said Mistletoe, nervously, keeping
her virtuous eyes on the volume.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed!&#8221; Miss Elaine answered, indifferently.
She was thinking harder than ever,&mdash;was,
in fact, inventing a little plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, so it&#8217;s you, deary!&#8221; cried the Governess,
much relieved. She had feared the Chaplain
might pick up the guilty magazine and find its
pages cut only at the place where the French
story was. And I am grieved to have to tell you
that this is just what he did do later in the evening,
and sat down in his private room and read
about Roger and Angelica himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a good one,&#8221; said Mistletoe. &#8220;Number
39, in the Appendix to Part Fourth. Chop
two pounds of leeks and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I may not be here to taste it,&#8221; said
Elaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless the child!&#8221; said Mistletoe. &#8220;And
where else would you be on Christmas-day but
in your own house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps far away. Who knows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t gone and seen a young man
and told him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A young man, indeed!&#8221; said Elaine, with a
toss of her head. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a young man in
England I would tell anything save to go about
his business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Elaine had never seen any young men
except when they came to dine on Sir Godfrey&#8217;s
invitation; and his manner on those occasions so
awed them that they always sat on the edge of
their chairs, and said, &#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; when the
Baron said, &#8220;Have some more capon?&#8221; Then
the Baron would snort, &#8220;Nonsense! Popham,
bring me Master Percival&#8217;s plate,&#8221; upon which
Master Percival invariably simpered, and said that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
really he did believe he <i>would</i> take another slice.
After these dinners, Miss Elaine retired to her
own part of the house; and that was all she ever
saw of young men, whom she very naturally
deemed a class to be despised as silly and wholly
lacking in self-assertion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then where in the name of good saints are
you going to be?&#8221; Mistletoe went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Elaine, slowly (and here she
looked very slyly at the old Governess, and then
quickly appeared to be considering the lace on
her dress), &#8220;why, of course, papa would not
permit me to sacrifice myself for one dragon or
twenty dragons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; screamed Mistletoe, all in a flurry (for
she was a fool). &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I know papa would say that,&#8221; said
Miss Elaine, demure as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mercy me!&#8221; squeaked Mistletoe; &#8220;we
are undone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure, I might agree with papa,&#8221; said
the artful thing, knowing well enough she was on
the right track.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oo&mdash;oo!&#8221; went the Governess, burying her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
nose in the household cookery-book and rocking
from side to side.</p>

<p>&#8220;But then I might not agree with papa, you
know. I might think,&mdash;might think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Miss
Elaine stopped at what she might think, for
really she hadn&#8217;t the slightest idea what to say
next.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right to think,&mdash;no right at
all!&#8221; burst out Mistletoe. &#8220;And you sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be
allowed to think. I&#8217;ll tell Sir Godfrey at once,
and he&#8217;ll forbid you. Oh, dear! oh, dear! just
before Christmas Eve, too! The only night in
the year! She has no time to change her mind;
and she&#8217;ll be eaten up if she goes, I know she
will. What villain told you of this, child? Let
me know, and he shall be punished at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not tell you that,&#8221; said Elaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then everybody will be suspected,&#8221; moaned
Mistletoe. &#8220;Everybody. The whole household.
And we shall all be thrown to the Dragon. Oh,
dear! was there ever such a state of things?&#8221;
The Governess betook herself to weeping and
wringing her hands, and Elaine stood watching
her and wondering how in the world she could find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
out more. She knew now just enough to keep her
from eating or sleeping until she knew everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with papa, at all,&#8221; she said,
during a lull in the tears. This was the only
remark she could think of.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll lock you up, and feed you on bread
and water till you do&mdash;oo&mdash;oo!&#8221; sobbed Mistletoe;
&#8220;and by that time we shall all be ea&mdash;ea&mdash;eaten
up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll talk to papa, and make him change
his mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t. Do you think you&#8217;re going to
make him care more about a lot of sheep and
cows than he does about his only daughter?
Doesn&#8217;t he pay the people for everything the
Dragon eats up? Who would pay him for you,
when you were eaten up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that I should be eaten
up?&#8221; asked Miss Elaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! oh, dear! and how could you stop
it? What could a girl do alone against a dragon
in the middle of the night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But on Christmas Eve?&#8221; suggested the young
lady. &#8220;There might be something different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
about that. He might feel better, you know, on
Christmas Eve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose a wicked, ravenous dragon
with a heathen tail is going to care whether it is
Christmas Eve or not? He&#8217;d have you for his
Christmas dinner, and that&#8217;s all the notice he
would take of the day. And then perhaps he
wouldn&#8217;t leave the country, after all. How can
you be sure he would go away, just because that
odious, vulgar legend says so? Who would rely
on a dragon? And so there you would be gone,
and he would be here, and everything!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mistletoe&#8217;s tears flowed afresh; but you see
she had said all that Miss Elaine was so curious
to know about, and the fatal secret was out.</p>

</div>

<p>The Quarter-Bell rang for dinner, and both the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
women hastened to their rooms to make ready;
Mistletoe still boo-hooing and snuffling, and declaring
that she had always said some wretched,
abominable villain would tell her child about that
horrid, ridiculous legend, that was a perfect falsehood,
as anybody could see, and very likely invented
by the Dragon himself, because no human
being with any feelings at all would think of such
a cruel, absurd idea; and if they ever did, they
deserved to be eaten themselves; and she would
not have it.</p>

<p>She said a great deal more that Elaine, in the
next room, could not hear (though the door was
open between), because the Governess put her
fat old face under the cold water in the basin,
and, though she went on talking just the same,
it only produced an angry sort of bubbling, which
conveyed very little notion of what she meant.</p>

<p>So they descended the stairway, Miss Elaine
walking first, very straight and solemn; and that
was the way she marched into the banquet-hall,
where Sir Godfrey waited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll meet the
Dragon on Christmas Eve!&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em; padding-top: 6.3em"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">round</span> the sullen towers
of Oyster-le-Main the
snow was falling steadily.
It was slowly banking up
in the deep sills of the
windows, and Hubert
the Sacristan had given
up sweeping the steps. Patches of it, that had
collected on the top of the great bell as the
slanting draughts blew it in through the belfry-window,
slid down from time to time among the
birds which had nestled for shelter in the beams
below. From the heavy main outer-gates, the
country spread in a white unbroken sheet to the
woods. Twice, perhaps, through the morning
had wayfarers toiled by along the nearly-obliterated
high-road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck to the holy men!&#8221; each had said
to himself as he looked at the chill and austere
walls of the Monastery. &#8220;Good luck! and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
hope that within there they be warmer than I
am.&#8221; Then I think it very likely that as he
walked on, blowing the fingers of the hand that
held his staff, he thought of his fireside and his
wife, and blessed Providence for not making him
pious enough to be a monk and a bachelor.</p>

<p>This is what was doing in the world outside.
Now inside the stone walls of Oyster-le-Main,
whose grim solidity spoke of narrow cells and of
pious knees continually bent in prayer, not a
monk paced the corridors, and not a step could
be heard above or below in the staircase that
wound up through the round towers. Silence
was everywhere, save that from a remote quarter
of the Monastery came a faint sound of music.
Upon such a time as Christmas Eve, it might well
be that carols in plenty would be sung or studied
by the saintly men. But this sounded like no
carol. At times the humming murmur of the
storm drowned the measure, whatever it was,
and again it came along the dark, cold entries,
clearer than before. Away in a long vaulted
room, whose only approach was a passage in the
thickness of the walls, safe from the intrusion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the curious, a company is sitting round a cavernous
chimney, where roars and crackles a great
blazing heap of logs. Surely, for a monkish
song, their melody is most odd; yet monks they
are, for all are clothed in gray, like Father Anselm,
and a rope round the waist of each. But
what can possibly be in that huge silver rundlet
into which they plunge their goblets so often?
The song grows louder than ever.</p>

<p>Which you see was coarse and vulgar language<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
for any one to be heard to use, and particularly
so for a godly celibate. But the words were
scarce said, when off fly those monks&#8217; hoods, and
the waist-ropes rattle as they fall on the floor,
and the gray gowns drop down and are kicked
away.</p>

<p>Every man jack of them is in black armour,
with a long sword buckled to his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Long cheer to the Guild of Go-as-you-Please!&#8221;
they shouted, hoarsely, and dashed
their drinking-horns on the board. Then filled
them again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us a song, Hubert,&#8221;
said one. &#8220;The day&#8217;s
a dull one out in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a while,&#8221; replied
Hubert, whose nose was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
hidden in his cup; &#8220;this new Wantley tipple is a
vastly comfortable brew. What d&#8217;ye call the stuff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Malvoisie, thou oaf?&#8221; said another; &#8220;and of
a delicacy many degrees above thy bumpkin
palate. Leave profaning it, therefore, and to thy
refrain without more ado.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most unctuous sir,&#8221; replied Hubert, &#8220;in demanding
me this favour, you seem forgetful that
the juice of Pleasure is sweeter than the milk
of Human Kindness. I&#8217;ll not sing to give thee
an opportunity to outnumber me in thy cups.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he filled and instantly emptied another
sound bumper of the Malvoisie, lurching slightly
as he did so. &#8220;Health!&#8221; he added, preparing to
swallow the next.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;A murrain on such pagan thirst!&#8221; exclaimed
he who had been toasted, snatching the cup
away. &#8220;Art thou altogether unslakable? Is
thy belly a lime-kiln? Nay, shalt taste not a
single drop more, Hubert, till we have a stave.
Come, tune up, man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me but leave to hold the empty vessel,
then,&#8221; the singer pleaded, falling on one knee in
mock supplication.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Accorded, thou sot!&#8221; laughed the other.
&#8220;Carol away, now!&#8221;</p>

<p>They fell into silence, each replenishing his
drinking-horn. The snow beat soft against the
window, and from outside, far above them,
sounded the melancholy note of the bell ringing
in the hour for meditation.</p>

<p>So Hubert began:</p>

<p>The roar of twenty lusty throats and the clatter
of cups banging on the table rendered the words
of the chorus entirely inaudible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Malvoisie for thee, Hubert,&#8221; said one
of the company, dipping into the rundlet. But
his hand struck against the dry bottom. They
had finished four gallons since breakfast, and it
was scarcely eleven gone on the clock!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am betrayed!&#8221; Hubert sang out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Then he added, &#8220;But there is a plenty where that
came from.&#8221; And with that he reached for his
gown, and, fetching out a bunch of great brass
keys, proceeded towards a tall door in the wall,
and turned the lock. The door swung open, and
Hubert plunged into the dark recess thus disclosed.
An exclamation of chagrin followed, and
the empty hide of a huge crocodile, with a pair
of trailing wings to it, came bumping out from
the closet into the hall, giving out many hollow
cracks as it floundered along, fresh from a vigourous
kick that the intemperate minstrel had
administered in his rage at having put his hand
into the open jaws of the monster instead of
upon the neck of the demijohn that contained
the Malvoisie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beshrew thee, Hubert!&#8221; said the voice of a
new-comer, who stood eyeing the proceedings
from a distance, near where he had entered;
&#8220;treat the carcase of our patron saint with a
more befitting reverence, or I&#8217;ll have thee caged
and put upon bread and water. Remember, that
whosoever kicks that skin in some sort kicks
me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Long life to the Dragon of Wantley!&#8221; said
Hubert, reappearing, very dusty, but clasping a
plump demijohn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hubert, my lad,&#8221; said the new-comer, &#8220;put
back that vessel of inebriation; and, because I
like thee well for thy youth and thy sweet voice,
do not therefore presume too far with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A somewhat uneasy pause followed upon this;
and while Hubert edged back into the closet
with his demijohn, Father Anselm frowned slightly
as his eyes turned upon the scene of late hilarity.</p>

<p>But where is the Dragon in his den? you ask.
Are we not coming to him soon? Ah, but we
have come to him. You shall hear the truth.
Never believe that sham story about More of
More Hall, and how he slew the Dragon of
Wantley. It is a gross fabrication of some unscrupulous
and mediocre literary person, who, I
make no doubt, was in the pay of More to blow
his trumpet so loud that a credulous posterity
might hear it. My account of the Dragon is the
only true one.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em; padding-top: 6.2em"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">n</span> those days of shifting
fortunes, of turbulence
and rapine, of knights-errant
and minstrels
seeking for adventure
and love, and of solitary
pilgrims and bodies of
pious men wandering over Europe to proclaim
that the duty of all was to arise and quell the
pagan defilers of the Holy Shrine, good men and
bad men, undoubted saints and unmistakable
sinners, drifted forward and back through every
country, came by night and by day to every
household, and lived their lives in that unbounded
and perilous freedom that put them at one
moment upon the top limit of their ambition or
their delight, and plunged them into violent and
bloody death almost ere the moment was gone.
It was a time when &#8220;fatten at thy neighbour&#8217;s
expense&#8221; was the one commandment observed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
by many who outwardly maintained a profound
respect for the original ten; and any man whose
wit taught him how this commandment could be
obeyed with the greatest profit and the least
danger was in high standing among his fellows.</p>

<p>Hence it was that Francis Almoign, Knight of
the Voracious Stomach, cumbered with no domestic
ties worthy of mention, a tall slim fellow
who knew the appropriate hour to slit a throat or
to wheedle a maid, came to be Grand Marshal of
the Guild of Go-as-you-Please.</p>

<p>This secret band, under its Grand Marshal,
roved over Europe and thrived mightily. Each
member was as stout hearted a villain as you
could see. Sometimes their doings came to light,
and they were forced to hasten across the borders
of an outraged territory into new pastures. Yet
they fared well in the main, for they could fight
and drink and sing; and many a fair one smiled
upon them, in spite of their perfectly outrageous
morals.</p>
</div>

<p>So, one day, they came into the neighbourhood
of Oyster-le-Main, where much confusion reigned
among the good monks. Sir Godfrey Disseisin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
over at Wantley had let Richard Lion Heart depart
for the Holy Wars without him. &#8220;Like
father like son,&#8221; the people muttered in their discontent.
&#8220;Sure, the Church will gravely punish
this second offence.&#8221; To all these whisperings
of rumour the Grand Marshal of the Guild paid
fast attention; for he was a man who laid his
plans deeply, and much in advance of the event.
He saw the country was fat and the neighbours
foolish. He took note of the handsome tithes
that came in to Oyster-le-Main for the support of
the monks. He saw all these things, and set
himself to thinking.</p>

<p>Upon a stormy afternoon, when the light was
nearly gone out of the sky, a band of venerable
pilgrims stood at the great gates of the Monastery.
Their garments were tattered, their
shoes were in sad disrepair. They had walked
(they said) all the way from Jerusalem. Might
they find shelter for the night? The tale they
told, and the mere sight of their trembling old
beards, would have melted hearts far harder than
those which beat in the breasts of the monks of
Oyster-le-Main. But above all, these pilgrims<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
brought with them as convincing proofs of their
journey a collection of relics and talismans (such
as are to be met with only in Eastern countries)
of great wonder and virtue. With singular generosity,
which they explained had been taught
them by the Arabs, they presented many of these
treasures to the delighted inmates of the Monastery,
who hastened to their respective cells,&mdash;this
one reverently cherishing a tuft of hair from
the tail of one of Daniel&#8217;s lions; another handling
with deep fervour a strip of the coat of many
colours once worn by the excellent Joseph. But
the most extraordinary relic among them all was
the skin of a huge lizard beast, the like of which
none in England had ever seen. This, the Pilgrims
told their hosts, was no less a thing than a
crocodile from the Nile, the renowned river of
Moses. It had been pressed upon them, as they
were departing from the City of Damascus, by a
friend, a blameless chiropodist, whose name was
Omar Khayyam. He it was who eked out a pious
groat by tending the feet of all outward and inward
bound pilgrims. Seated at the entrance of
his humble booth, with the foot of some holy man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
in his lap, he would speak words of kindness and
wisdom as he reduced the inflammation. One of
his quaintest sayings was, &#8220;If the Pope has bid
thee wear hair next thy bare skin, my son, why,
clap a wig over thy shaven scalp.&#8221; So the
monks in proper pity and kindness, when they
had shut the great gates as night came down,
made their pilgrim guests welcome to bide at
Oyster-le-Main as long as they pleased. The
solemn bell for retiring rolled forth in the darkness
with a single deep clang, and the sound
went far and wide over the neighbouring district.
Those peasants who were still awake in their
scattered cottages, crossed themselves as they
thought, &#8220;The holy men at Oyster-le-Main are
just now going to their rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>And thus the world outside grew still, and the
thick walls of the Monastery loomed up against
the stars.</p>

<p>Deep in the midnight, many a choking cry
rang fearfully through the stony halls, but came
not to the outer air; and the waning moon shone
faintly down upon the enclosure of the garden,
where worked a band of silent grave-diggers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
clad in black armour, and with blood-red hands.
The good country folk, who came at early morning
with their presents of poultry and milk,
little guessed what sheep&#8217;s clothing the gray
cowls and gowns of Oyster-le-Main had become
in a single night, nor what impious lips those
were which now muttered blessings over their
bent heads.</p>

<p>The following night, hideous sounds were
heard in the fields, and those who dared to open
their shutters to see what the matter was, beheld
a huge lizard beast, with fiery breath and accompanied
by rattling thunder, raging over the soil,
which he hardly seemed to touch!</p>

<p>In this manner did the dreaded Dragon of
Wantley make his appearance, and in this manner
did Sir Francis Almoign, Knight of the
Voracious Stomach, stand in the shoes of that
Father Anselm whom he had put so comfortably
out of the way under the flower-beds in the
Monastery garden,&mdash;and never a soul in the
world except his companions in orgy to know
the difference. He even came to be welcome
at Sir Godfrey&#8217;s table; for after the Dragon&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
appearance, the Baron grew civil to all members
of the Church. By day this versatile sinner, the
Grand Marshal, would walk in the sight of the
world with staid step, clothed in gray, his hood
concealing his fierce, unchurchly eyes; by night,
inside the crocodile skin, he visited what places
he chose, unhindered by the terrified dwellers,
and after him came his followers of the Guild to
steal the plunder and bear it back inside the
walls of Oyster-le-Main. Never in all their adventures
had these superb miscreants been in
better plight; but now the trouble had begun,
as you are going to hear. We return to Hubert
and the company.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hubert and all of you,&#8221; said Father Anselm,
or rather Sir Francis, the Grand Marshal, as we
know him to be, &#8220;they say that whom the gods
desire to destroy, him do they first make drunk
with wine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The application! the application!&#8221; they
shouted in hoarse and mirthful chorus, for they
were certainly near that state favourable to destruction
by the gods. One black fellow with a
sliding gait ran into the closet and brought a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
sheet of thin iron, and a strange torch-like tube,
which he lighted at the fire and blew into from
the other end. A plume of spitting flame immediately
shot far into the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a name="hubert" id="hubert"></a>
<img src="images/illo_png071.jpg" width="300" height="327" alt="Hubert looketh out of ye Window" title="Hubert looketh out of ye Window" />
</div>

<p>&#8220;Before thy sermon proceeds, old Dragon,&#8221;
he said, puffing unsteady but solemn breaths
between his words, &#8220;wrap up in lightning and
thunder that we may be&mdash;may be&mdash;lieve what
you say.&#8221; Then he shook the iron till it gave
forth a frightful shattering sound. The Grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Marshal said not a word. With three long steps
he stood towering in front of the man and dealt
him a side blow under the ear with his steel fist.
He fell instantly, folding together like something
boneless, and lay along the floor for a moment
quite still, except that some piece in his armour
made a light rattling as though there were
muscles that quivered beneath it. Then he
raised himself slowly to a bench where his
brothers sat waiting, soberly enough. Only
young Hubert grinned aside to his neighbour,
who, perceiving it, kept his eyes fixed as far from
that youth as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy turn next, if art not careful, Hubert,&#8221;
said Sir Francis very quietly, as he seated himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonder of saints!&#8221; Hubert thought secretly,
not moving at all, &#8220;how could he have seen
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis no small piece of good fortune,&#8221; continued
the Grand Marshal, &#8220;that some one
among us can put aside his slavish appetites, and
keep a clear eye on the watch against misadventure.
Here is my news. That hotch-pot of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
lies we set going among the people has fallen
foul of us. The daughter of Sir Godfrey has
heard our legend, and last week told her sire
that to-night she would follow it out to the letter,
and meet the Dragon of Wantley alone in single
combat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she never loved any man?&#8221; asked one.</p>

<p>&#8220;She fulfils every condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That most consummate of fools, the Mistletoe,&#8221;
said the Grand Marshal.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Sir Godfrey do upon that?&#8221; inquired
Hubert.</p>

<p>&#8220;He locked up his girl and chained the Governess
to a rock, where she has remained in
deadly terror ever since, but kept fat for me to
devour her. Me!&#8221; and Sir Francis permitted
himself to smile, though not very broadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How if Sir Dragon had found the maid
chained instead of the ancient widow?&#8221; Hubert
said, venturing to tread a little nearer to familiarity
on the strength of the amusement which
played across the Grand Master&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Hubert boy,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I see it is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
in the Spring only, but in Autumn and Summer
and Winter as well, that thy fancy turns to
thoughts of love. Did the calendar year but
contain a fifth season, in that also wouldst thou
be making honey-dew faces at somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>But young Hubert only grinned, and closed
his flashing eyes a little, in satisfaction at the
character which had been given him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time presses,&#8221; Sir Francis said. &#8220;By noon
we shall receive an important visit. There has
been a great sensation at Wantley. The country
folk are aroused; the farmers have discovered
that the secret of our legend has been revealed
to Miss Elaine. Not one of the clowns would
have dared reveal it himself, but all rejoice in the
bottom of their hearts that she knows it, and
chooses to risk battle with the Dragon. Their
honest Saxon minds perceive the thrift of such an
arrangement. Therefore there is general anxiety
and disturbance to know if Sir Godfrey will permit
the conflict. The loss of his Malvoisie tried
him sorely,&mdash;but he remains a father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s kind in him,&#8221; said Hubert.</p>

<p>Sir Francis turned a cold eye on Hubert.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
&#8220;As befits a clean-blooded man,&#8221; he proceeded,
&#8220;I have risen at the dawn and left you wine-pots
in your thick sleep. From the wood&#8217;s edge over
by Wantley I&#8217;ve watched the Baron come eagerly
to an upper window in his white night-shift. And
when he looks out on Mistletoe and sees she is
not devoured, he bursts into a rage that can be
plainly seen from a distance. These six mornings
I laughed so loud at this spectacle, that I
almost feared discovery. Next, the Baron visits
his daughter, only to find her food untasted and
herself silent. I fear she is less of a fool than the
rest. But now his paternal heart smites him, and
he has let her out. Also the Governess is free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a girl as that would not flinch from
meeting our Dragon,&#8221; said Hubert; &#8220;aye, or
from seeking him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She must never meet the Dragon,&#8221; Sir Francis
declared. &#8220;What could I do shut up in the
crocodile, and she with a sword, of course?&#8221;</p>

<p>They were gloomily silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not devour her properly as a dragon
should. Nor could I carry her away,&#8221; pursued
Sir Francis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Hubert, who had gone to the window,
returned hastily, exclaiming, &#8220;They are coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are coming?&#8221; asked several.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Baron, his daughter, the Governess, and
all Wantley at their backs, to ask our pious advice,&#8221;
said the Grand Marshal. &#8220;Quick, into
your gowns, one and all! Be monks outside,
though you stay men underneath.&#8221; For a while
the hall was filled with jostling gray figures entangled
in the thick folds of the gowns, into which
the arms, legs, and heads had been thrust regardless
of direction; the armour clashed invisible
underneath as the hot and choked members
of the Guild plunged about like wild animals
sewed into sacks, in their struggles to reappear
in decent monastic attire. The winged crocodile
was kicked into the closet, after it were hurled
the thunder machine and the lightning torch, and
after them clattered the cups and the silver rundlet.
Barely had Hubert turned the key, when
knocking at the far-off gate was heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go down quickly, Hubert,&#8221; said the Grand
Marshal, &#8220;and lead them all here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently the procession of laity, gravely escorted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
by Hubert, began to file into the now
barren-looking room, while the monks stood with
hands folded, and sang loudly what sounded to
the uninstructed ears of each listener like a Latin
hymn.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em; padding-top: 8em"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">ith</span> the respect that was
due to holy men, Sir
Godfrey removed his
helmet, and stood waiting
in a decent attitude
of attention to the
hymn, although he did not understand a single
word of it. The long deliberate Latin words
rolled out very grand to his ear, and, to tell you
the truth, it is just as well his scholarship was
faulty, for this is the English of those same
words:</p>

<div class="poem" style="padding-top: 1em"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;It is my intention<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To die in a tavern,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That angels in chorus<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></div></div>

<p>But so devoutly did the monks dwell upon the
syllables, so earnestly were the arms of each one
folded against his breast, that you would never
have suspected any unclerical sentiments were
being expressed. The proximity of so many
petticoats and kirtles caused considerable restlessness
to Hubert; but he felt the burning eye
of the Grand Marshal fixed upon him, and sang
away with all his might.</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey began to grow impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hem!&#8221; he said, moving his foot slightly.</p>

<p>This proceeding, however, was without result.
The pious chant continued to resound, and the
monks paid not the least attention to their visitors,
but stood up together in a double line,
vociferating Latin with as much zest as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mort d&#8217;aieul!&#8221; growled Sir Godfrey, shifting
his other foot, and not so gingerly this second
time.</p>
</div>

<p>By chance the singing stopped upon the same
instant, so that the Baron&#8217;s remark and the noise
his foot had made sounded all over the room.
This disconcerted him; for he felt his standing
with the Church to be weak, and he rolled his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
eyes from one side to the other, watching for any
effect his disturbance might have made. But,
with the breeding of a true man of the world, the
Grand Marshal merely observed, &#8220;Benedicite,
my son!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Father,&#8221; returned Sir Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what would you with me?&#8221; pursued the
so-called Father Anselm. &#8220;Speak, my son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the fact is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; the Baron began,
marching forward; but he encountered the eye
of the Abbot, where shone a cold surprise at this
over-familiar fashion of speech; so he checked
himself, and, in as restrained a voice as he could
command, told his story. How his daughter had
determined to meet the Dragon, and so save
Wantley; how nothing that a parent could say
had influenced her intentions in the least; and
now he placed the entire matter in the hands of
the Church.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which would have been more becoming if
you had done it at the first,&#8221; said Father Anselm,
reprovingly. Then he turned to Miss Elaine,
who all this while had been looking out of the
window with the utmost indifference.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;How is this, my daughter?&#8221; he said gravely,
in his deep voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the dear blessed man!&#8221; whispered Mistletoe,
admiringly, to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is as you hear, Father,&#8221; said Miss Elaine,
keeping her eyes away.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why do you think that such a peril upon
your part would do away with this Dragon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Says not the legend so?&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what may the legend be, my daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>With some surprise that so well informed a
person as Father Anselm should be ignorant of
this prominent topic of the day, Sir Godfrey here
broke in and narrated the legend to him with
many vigourous comments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; said the Father, smiling gently
when the story was done; &#8220;I do now remember
that some such child&#8217;s tale was in the mouths of
the common folk once; but methought the nonsense
was dead long since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The nonsense, Father!&#8221; exclaimed Elaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of a surety, my child. Dost suppose that
Holy Church were so unjust as to visit the sins
of thy knightly relatives upon the head of any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
weak woman, who is not in the order of creation
designed for personal conflict with men, let alone
dragons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravo, Dragon!&#8221; thought Hubert, as he
listened to this wily talk of his chief.</p>

<p>But the words &#8220;weak woman&#8221; had touched
the pride of Miss Elaine. &#8220;I know nothing of
weak women,&#8221; she said, very stately; &#8220;but I do
know that I am strong enough to meet this
Dragon, and, moreover, firmly intend to do so
this very night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace, my daughter,&#8221; said the monk; &#8220;and
listen to the voice of thy mother the Church
speaking through the humblest of her servants.
This legend of thine holds not a single grain of
truth. &#8217;Tis a conceit of the common herd, set
afoot by some ingenious fellow who may have
thought he was doing a great thing in devising
such fantastic mixture. True it is that the Monster
is a visitation to punish the impiety of certain
members of thy family. True it is that he will
not depart till a member of that family perform
a certain act. But it is to be a male descendant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Sir Godfrey&#8217;s boy Roland was being instructed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in knightly arts and conduct away from
home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221; inquired the Baron, as
the thought of his precious wine-cellar came into
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;On last Christmas Eve I had a vision,&#8221; replied
Father Anselm. &#8220;Thy grandfather, the
brave youth who by journeying to the Holy War
averted this curse until thine own conduct caused
it to descend upon us, appeared to me in shining
armour. &#8216;Anselm,&#8217; he said, and raised his right
arm, &#8216;the Dragon is a grievous burden on the
people. I can see that from where I am. Now,
Anselm, when the fitting hour shall come, and
my great-grandson&#8217;s years be mature enough to
have made a man of him, let him go to the next
Holy War that is proclaimed, and on the very
night of his departure the curse will be removed
and our family forgiven. More than this, Anselm,
if any male descendant from me direct
shall at any time attend a Crusade when it is
declared, the country will be free forever.&#8217; So
saying, he dissolved out of my sight in a silver
gleaming mist.&#8221; Here Father Anselm paused,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and from under his hood watched with a trifle of
anxiety the effect of his speech.</p>

<p>There was a short silence, and then Sir Godfrey
said, &#8220;Am I to understand this thing hangs
on the event of another Crusade?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Abbot bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, till that event happen, the Dragon
can rage unchecked?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Abbot bowed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will there be another Crusade along pretty
soon?&#8221; Sir Godfrey pursued.</p>

<p>&#8220;These things lie not in human knowledge,&#8221;
replied Father Anselm. He little dreamed what
news the morrow&#8217;s sun would see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my sheep!&#8221; groaned many a poor
farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my Burgundy!&#8221; groaned Sir Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; exclaimed Elaine, her cheeks
pink with excitement, &#8220;I shall try the virtue of
the legend, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most impious, my daughter, most impious
will such conduct be in the sight of Mother
Church,&#8221; said Father Anselm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear me, all people!&#8221; shouted Sir Godfrey,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
foreseeing that
before the next
Crusade came
every drop of
wine in his cellar would be swallowed by the
Dragon; &#8220;hear me proclaim and solemnly promise:
legend true or legend false, my daughter shall
not face this risk. But if her heart go with it,
her hand shall be given to that man who by night
or light brings me this Dragon, alive or dead!&#8221;</p>

<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:500px; height:100px;"> </div>
<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:330px; height:115px;"> </div>


<p>&#8220;A useless promise, Sir Godfrey!&#8221; said Father
Anselm, shrugging his shoulders. &#8220;We dare not
discredit the word of thy respected grandsire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My respected grandsire be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What?</i>&#8221; said the Abbot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Became a credit to his family,&#8221; said the
Baron, quite mildly; &#8220;and I slight no word of
his. But he did not contradict this legend in the
vision, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he did not, papa,&#8221; Miss Elaine put in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
&#8220;He only mentioned another way of getting rid
of this horrible Dragon. Now, papa, whatever
you may say about&mdash;about my heart and hand,&#8221;
she continued firmly, &#8220;I am going to meet the
Monster alone myself, to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you shall not,&#8221; said Sir Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;A hundred times no!&#8221; said a new voice from
the crowd. &#8220;I will meet him myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>All turned and saw a knight pushing his way
through the people.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; inquired the Baron.</p>

<p>The stranger bowed haughtily; and Elaine
watched him remove his helmet, and reveal underneath
it the countenance of a young man who
turned to her, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>Why, what&#8217;s this, Elaine? Why does everything
seem to swim and grow misty as his eye
meets yours? And why does he look at you so,
and deeply flush to the very rim of his curly hair?
And as his glance grows steadier and more intent
upon your eyes that keep stealing over at him,
can you imagine why his hand trembles on the
hilt of his sword? Don&#8217;t you remember what the
legend said?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; the Baron repeated, impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Geoffrey, son of Bertram of Poictiers,&#8221;
answered the young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what,&#8221; asked Father Anselm, with a
certain irony in his voice, &#8220;does Geoffrey, son of
Bertram of Poictiers, so far away from his papa in
this inclement weather?&#8221;</p>

<p>The knight surveyed the monk for a moment,
and then said, &#8220;As thou art not my particular
Father Confessor, stick to those matters which
concern thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>This reply did not please any man present, for
it seemed to savour of disrespect. But Elaine
lost no chance of watching the youth, who now
stood alone in the middle of the hall. Sir Francis
detected this, and smiled with a sly smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will some person inquire of this polite young
man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what he wishes with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me where this Dragon of Wantley
comes,&#8221; said Geoffrey, &#8220;for I intend to slay him
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, sir,&#8221; fluttered Elaine, stepping towards
him a little, &#8220;I hope&mdash;that is, I beg you&#8217;ll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
do no such dangerous thing as that for my
sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For your sake?&#8221; Father Anselm broke in.
&#8220;For your sake? And why so? What should
Elaine, daughter of Sir Godfrey Disseisin, care
for the carcase of Geoffrey, son of Bertram of
Poictiers?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Elaine, finding nothing to answer, turned
rosy pink instead.</p>

<p>&#8220;That rules you out!&#8221; exclaimed the Father,
in triumph. &#8220;Your legend demands a maid who
never has cared for any man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Geoffrey, &#8220;leave it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seize him!&#8221; shouted Sir Godfrey in a rage.
&#8220;He had ruled out my daughter.&#8221; Consistency
had never been one of the Baron&#8217;s strong points.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seize him!&#8221; said Father Anselm. &#8220;He outrages
Mother Church.&#8221;</p>

<p>The vassals closed up behind young Geoffrey,
who was pinioned in a second. He struggled
with them till the veins stood out in his forehead
in blue knots; but, after all, one young man of
twenty is not much among a band of stout yeomen;
and they all fell in a heap on the floor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
pulling and tugging at Geoffrey, who had blacked
several eyes, and done in a general way as much
damage as he possibly could under the circumstances.</p>

<p>But Elaine noticed one singular occurrence.
Not a monk had moved to seize the young
man, except one, who rushed forward, and was
stopped, as though struck to stone, by Father
Anselm&#8217;s saying to him in a terrible undertone,
&#8220;Hubert!&#8221;</p>

<p>Simply that word, spoken quickly; but not
before this Hubert had brushed against her so
that she was aware that there was something very
hard and metallic underneath his gray gown.
She betrayed no sign of knowledge or surprise
on her face, however, but affected to be absorbed
wholly in the fortunes of young Geoffrey, whom
she saw collared and summarily put into a cage-like
prison whose front was thick iron bars, and
whose depth was in the vast outer wall of the
Monastery, with a little window at the rear, covered
with snow. The spring-lock of the gate
shut upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Father Anselm, as the Monastery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
bell sounded once more, &#8220;if our guests
will follow us, the mid-day meal awaits us below.
We will deal with this hot-head later,&#8221; he added,
pointing to the prisoner.</p>

<p>So they slowly went out, leaving Geoffrey
alone with his thoughts.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 8em; text-indent: 0em"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">own</span> stairs the Grace
was said, and the company
was soon seated
and ready for their mid-day
meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our fare,&#8221; said
Father Anselm pleasantly to Sir Godfrey, who
sat on his right, &#8220;is plain, but substantial.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;ah, very likely,&#8221; replied the Baron, as
he received a wooden basin of black-bean broth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our drink is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baron lifted his eye hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;remarkably pure water,&#8221; Father Anselm
continued. &#8220;Clement!&#8221; he called to the monk
whose turn it was that day to hand the dishes,
&#8220;Clement, a goblet of our well-water for Sir
Godfrey Disseisin. One of the large goblets,
Clement. We are indeed favoured, Baron, in
having such a pure spring in the midst of our
home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;ah!&#8221; observed the Baron again, and politely
nerved himself for a swallow. But his
thoughts were far away in his own cellar over at
Wantley, contemplating the casks whose precious
gallons the Dragon had consumed. Could it be
the strength of his imagination, or else why was
it that through the chilling, unwelcome liquid he
was now drinking he seemed to detect a lurking
flavour of the very wine those casks had contained,
his favourite Malvoisie?</p>
</div>

<p>Father Anselm noticed the same taste in his
own cup, and did not set it down to imagination,
but afterwards sentenced Brother Clement to
bread and water during three days, for carelessness
in not washing the Monastery table-service
more thoroughly.</p>

<p>&#8220;This simple food keeps you in beautiful health,
Father,&#8221; said Mistletoe, ogling the swarthy face
of the Abbot with an affection that he duly noted.</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter,&#8221; he replied, gravely, &#8220;bodily
infirmity is the reward of the glutton. I am well,
thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Elaine did not eat much. Her
thoughts were busy, and hurrying over recent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
events. Perhaps you think she lost her heart in
the last Chapter, and cannot lose it in this one
unless it is given back to her. But I do not
agree with you; and I am certain that, if you
suggested such a notion to her, she would become
quite angry, and tell you not to talk such
foolish nonsense. People are so absurd about
hearts, and all that sort of thing! No: I do not
really think she has lost her heart yet; but as
she sits at table these are the things she is
feeling:</p>

<p>1. Not at all hungry.</p>

<p>2. Not at all thirsty.</p>

<p>3. What a hateful person that Father Anselm
is!</p>

<p>4. Poor, poor young man!</p>

<p>5. Not that she thinks of him in <i>that</i> way, of
course. The idea! Horrid Father Anselm!</p>

<p>6. Any girl at all&mdash;no, not girl, <i>anybody</i> at all&mdash;who
had human justice would feel exactly as
she did about the whole matter.</p>

<p>7. He was very good-looking, too.</p>

<p>8. Did he have&mdash;yes, they were blue. Very,
very dark blue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>9. And a moustache? Well, yes.</p>

<p>Here she laughed, but no one noticed her
idling with her spoon. Then her eyes filled with
tears, and she pretended to be absorbed with the
black-bean broth, though, as a matter of fact, she
did not see it in the least.</p>

<p>10. Why had he come there at all?</p>

<p>11. It was a perfect shame, treating him so.</p>

<p>12. Perhaps they were not blue, after all.
But, oh! what a beautiful sparkle was in them!</p>

<p>After this, she hated Father Anselm worse than
ever. And the more she hated him, the more
some very restless delicious something made her
draw long breaths. She positively must go up-stairs
and see what He was doing and what He
really looked like. This curiosity seized hold of
her and set her thinking of some way to slip away
unseen. The chance came through all present
becoming deeply absorbed in what Sir Godfrey
was saying to Father Anselm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a low, coarse, untaught brute as a
dragon,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;cannot possibly distinguish
good wine from bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of a surety, no!&#8221; responded the monk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;You agree with me upon that point?&#8221; said
the Baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most certainly. Proceed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to see that he gets nothing
but the cider and small beer after this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how will you prevent him, if he visit your
cellar again?&#8221; Father Anselm inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall change all the labels, in the first
place,&#8221; the Baron answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! vastly well conceived,&#8221; said Father Anselm.
&#8220;You will label your Burgundy as if it
were beer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And next,&#8221; continued Sir Godfrey, &#8220;I shall
shift the present positions of the hogsheads.
That I shall do to-day, after relabelling. In the
northern corner of the first wine vault I
shall&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as he reached this point, it was quite
wonderful how strict an attention every monk
paid to his words. They leaned forward, forgetting
their dinner, and listened with all their
might.</p>

<p>One of them, who had evidently received an
education, took notes underneath the table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Thus it was that Elaine escaped observation
when she left the refectory.</p>

</div>

<p>As she came up-stairs into the hall where Geoffrey
was caged, she stepped lightly and kept
where she could not be seen by him. All was
quiet when she entered; but suddenly she heard
the iron bars of the cage begin to rattle and
shake, and at the same time Geoffrey&#8217;s voice
broke out in rage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll twist you loose,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&mdash;(rattle,
shake)&mdash;you&mdash;(kick, bang)&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And here the
shocking young man used words so violent and
wicked that Elaine put her hands tight over her
ears. &#8220;Why, he is just as dreadful as papa, just
exactly!&#8221; she exclaimed to herself. &#8220;Whoever
would have thought that that angelic face&mdash;but I
suppose they are all like that sometimes.&#8221; And
she took her hands away again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will twist you loose,&#8221; he was growling
hoarsely, while the kicks and wrenches grew
fiercer than ever, &#8220;or twist myself stark, staring
blind&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sir!&#8221; she said, running out in front of the
cage.</p>

<p>He stopped at once, and stood looking at
her. His breast-plate and gauntlets were down
on the floor, so his muscles might have more easy
play in dealing with the bars. Elaine noticed
that the youth&#8217;s shirt was of very costly Eastern
silk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking of getting out,&#8221; he said at
length, still standing and looking at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I might&mdash;that is&mdash;you might&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>&mdash;&#8221;
began Miss Elaine, and stopped. Upon which
another silence followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady, who sent you here?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they don&#8217;t know!&#8221; she replied, hastily;
and then, seeing how bright his face became, and
hearing her own words, she looked down, and
the crimson went over her cheeks as he watched
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if I could get out!&#8221; he said, desperately.
&#8220;Lady, what is your name, if I might be so bold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name, sir, is Elaine. Perhaps there is a
key somewhere,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am called Geoffrey,&#8221; he said, in reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we might find a key,&#8221; Elaine repeated.</p>

<p>She turned towards the other side of the room,
and there hung a great bunch of brass keys dangling
from the lock of a heavy door.</p>

<p>Ah, Hubert! thou art more careless than
Brother Clement, I think, to have left those keys
in such a place!</p>

<p>Quickly did Elaine cross to that closed door,
and laid her hand upon the bunch. The door
came open the next moment, and she gave a
shriek to see the skin of a huge lizard-beast fall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
forward at her feet, and also many cups and
flagons, that rolled over the floor, dotting it with
little drops of wine.</p>

<p>Hearing Elaine shriek, and not able to see from
his prison what had befallen her, Geoffrey shouted
out in terror to know if she had come to any hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she told him; and stood eyeing first
the crocodile&#8217;s hide and then the cups, setting
her lips together very firmly. &#8220;And they were
not even dry,&#8221; she said after a while. For she
began to guess a little of the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not dry? Who?&#8221; inquired Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Geoffrey!&#8221; she burst out in deep anger,
and then stopped, bewildered. But his heart
leaped to hear her call his name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there no keys?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keys? Yes!&#8221; she cried, and, running with
them back to the bars, began trying one after
another in trembling haste till the lock clicked
pleasantly, and out marched young Geoffrey.</p>

<p>Now what do you suppose this young man did
when he found himself free once more, and
standing close by the lovely young person to
whom he owed his liberty? Did he place his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
heels together, and let his arms hang gracefully,
and so bow with respect and a manner at once
dignified and urbane, and say, &#8220;Miss Elaine, permit
me to thank you for being so kind as to let
me out of prison?&#8221; That is what he ought to
have done, of course, if he had known how to
conduct himself like a well-brought-up young
man. But I am sorry to have to tell you that
Geoffrey did nothing of the sort, but, instead of
that, behaved in a most outrageous manner. He
did not thank her at all. He did not say one
single word to her. He simply put one arm
round her waist and gave her a kiss!</p>

<p>&#8220;Geoffrey!&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Geoffrey did, with the most astonishing
and complacent disobedience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Geoffrey!&#8221; she whispered, looking the
other way, &#8220;how wrong of you! And of me!&#8221;
she added a little more softly still, escaping from
him suddenly, and facing about.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that,&#8221; said Geoffrey. &#8220;I love
you, Elaine. Elaine, darling, I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you mustn&#8217;t!&#8221; answered she, stepping
back as he came nearer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<div class="backright" style="background-image: url(images/illo_png103.jpg); height: 100%;">

<div class="sandbag-right" style="width:350px; height:25px;"> </div>

<div class="sandbag-right" style="width:200px; height:300px;"> </div>

<p>This was simply
frightful! And so
sudden. To think of
her&mdash;Elaine!&mdash;but
she couldn&#8217;t think at
all. Happy? Why,
how wicked! How
had she ever&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you must
not,&#8221; she repeated,
and backed away
still farther.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I will!&#8221; said
this lover, quite loudly, and sprang so quickly to
where she stood that she was in his arms again,
and this time without the faintest chance of getting
out of them until he should choose to free her.</p>

<p>It was no use to struggle now, and she was
still, like some wild bird. But she knew that she
was really his, and was glad of it. And she
looked up at him and said, very softly, &#8220;Geoffrey,
we are wasting time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, not at all,&#8221; said Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say that you love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But haven&#8217;t I&mdash;ah, Geoffrey, please don&#8217;t
begin again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say that you love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did.</p>

<p>Then, taking his hand, she led him to the door
she had opened. He stared at the crocodile, at
the wine-cups, and then he picked up a sheet of
iron and a metal torch.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it is their museum,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Their museum! Geoffrey, think a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem to keep very good wine,&#8221; he remarked,
after smelling at the demijohn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see? Can&#8217;t you understand?&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not a bit. What&#8217;s that thing, do you
suppose?&#8221; he added, giving the crocodile a kick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, me, but men are simple, men are
simple!&#8221; said Elaine, in despair. &#8220;Geoffrey,
listen! That wine is my father&#8217;s wine, from his
own cellar. There is none like it in all England.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t see why he gave it to a parcel
of monks,&#8221; replied the young man.</p>

<p>Elaine clasped her hands in hopelessness, gave
him a kiss, and became mistress of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Geoffrey,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I will tell you
what you and I have really found out.&#8221; Then
she quickly recalled all the recent events. How
her father&#8217;s cellar had been broken into; how
Mistletoe had been chained to a rock for a week
and no dragon had come near her. She bade
him remember how just now Father Anselm had
opposed every plan for meeting the Dragon, and
at last she pointed to the crocodile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; said Geoffrey, after thinking for a
space. &#8220;Then you mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I do,&#8221; she interrupted. &#8220;The
Dragon of Wantley is now down-stairs with papa
eating dinner, and pretending he never drinks
anything stronger than water. What do you say
to that, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a foul thing!&#8221; cried the knight.
&#8220;Here have I been damnably duped. Here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
but speech deserted him. He glared at the crocodile
with a bursting countenance, then drove his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
toe against it with such vigour that it sailed like
a foot-ball to the farther end of the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa has been duped, and everybody,&#8221; said
Elaine. &#8220;Papa&#8217;s French wine&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They swore to me in Flanders I should find
a real dragon here,&#8221; he continued, raging up
and down, and giving to the young lady no part
of his attention. She began to fear he was not
thinking of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Geoffrey&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;They swore it. They had invited me to
hunt a dragon with them in Flanders,&mdash;Count
Faux Pas and his Walloons. We hunted day
and night, and the quest was barren. They then
directed me to this island of Britain, in which
they declared a dragon might be found by any
man who so desired. They lied in their throats.
I have come leagues for nothing.&#8221; Here he
looked viciously at the distant hide of the crocodile.
&#8220;But I shall slay the monk,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;A masquerading caitiff! Lying varlets! And
all for nothing! The monk shall die, however.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you come for nothing, Geoffrey?&#8221;
murmured Elaine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Three years have I been seeking dragons in
all countries, chasing deceit over land and sea.
And now once more my dearest hope falls empty
and stale. Why, what&#8217;s this?&#8221; A choking
sound beside him stopped the flow of his complaints.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Geoffrey,&mdash;oh, miserable me!&#8221; The
young lady was dissolved in tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Elaine&mdash;dearest&mdash;don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said you had come for n&mdash;nothing, and
it was all st&mdash;stale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, I am a fool, indeed! But it was the
Dragon, dearest. I had made so sure of an
honest one in this adventure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh!&#8221; went Miss Elaine, with her head
against his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there! You&#8217;re sweeter than all the
dragons in the world, my little girl,&#8221; said he.
And although this does not appear to be a great
compliment, it comforted her wonderfully in the
end; for he said it in her ear several times without
taking his lips away. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;I was a fool. By your father&#8217;s own word you&#8217;re
mine. I have caught the Dragon. Come, my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
girl! We&#8217;ll down to the refectory forthwith and
denounce him.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this, he seized Elaine&#8217;s hand and hastily
made for the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;But hold, Geoffrey, hold! Oh&mdash;I am driven
to act not as maidens should,&#8221; sighed Elaine.
&#8220;He it is who ought to do the thinking. But,
dear me! he does not know how. Do you not
see we should both be lost, were you to try any
such wild plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. Your father would give you to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no, Geoffrey; indeed, papa would
not. His promise was about a dragon. A live
or a dead dragon must be brought to him. Even
if he believed you now, even if that dreadful
Father Anselm could not invent some lie to put
us in the wrong, you and I could never&mdash;that is&mdash;papa
would not feel bound by his promise
simply because you did that. There must be a
dragon somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can there be a dragon if there is not a
dragon?&#8221; asked Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, wait, Geoffrey! Oh, how can I think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of everything all at once?&#8221; and Elaine pressed
her hands to her temples.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling,&#8221; said the knight, with his arms once
more around her, &#8220;let us fly now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now? They would catch us at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch us! not they! with my sword&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Geoffrey, of course you are brave.
But do be sensible. You are only one. No!
I won&#8217;t even argue such nonsense. They must
never know about what we have been doing up
here; and you must go back into that cage at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, and be locked up, and perhaps murdered
to-night, and never see your face again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you shall see me again, and soon. That
is what I am thinking about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you come in here, Elaine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must come to me. I have it! To-night,
at half-past eleven, come to the cellar-door
at the Manor, and I will be there to let you in.
Then we can talk over everything quietly. I
have no time to think now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cellar! at the Manor! And how, pray,
shall I get out of that cage?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannot you jump from the little window at
the back?&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey ran in to see. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said, returning;
&#8220;it is many spans from the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elaine had hurried into the closet, whence she
returned with a dusty coil of rope. &#8220;Here,
Geoffrey; quickly! put it about your waist.
Wind it so. But how clumsy you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood smiling down at her, and she very
deftly wound the cord up and down, over and
over his body, until its whole length lay comfortably
upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, your breast-plate, quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>She helped him put his armour on again; and,
as they were engaged at that, singing voices
came up the stairs from the distant dining-hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Grace,&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;they will be
here in a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey took a last kiss, and bolted into his
cage. She, with the keys, made great haste to
push the crocodile and other objects once more
into their hiding-place. Cups and flagons and
all rattled back without regard to order, as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
had already been flung not two hours before.
The closet-door shut, and Elaine hung the keys
from the lock as she had found them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Half-past eleven,&#8221; she said to Geoffrey, as
she ran by his cage towards the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;One more, darling,&mdash;please, one! through
the bars!&#8221; he besought her, in a voice so tender,
that for my part I do not see how she had the
heart to refuse him. But she continued her way,
and swiftly descending the stairs was found by
the company, as they came from the hall, busily
engaged in making passes with Sir Godfrey&#8217;s
sword, which he had left leaning near the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;A warlike daughter, Sir Godfrey!&#8221; said
Father Anselm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, if I were a man to go on a Crusade!&#8221;
sighed Miss Elaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hast thou, my daughter,&#8221; said Father Anselm,
&#8220;thought better of thy rash intentions
concerning this Dragon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am travelling towards better thoughts,
Father,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>But Sir Francis did not wholly believe the
young lady; and was not at rest until Sir Godfrey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
assured him her good conduct should be no
matter of her own choosing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; insinuated the Abbot, &#8220;so sweet
a maid as yours would be a treat for the unholy
beast. A meal like that would incline him to
remain in a neighbourhood where such dainties
were to be found.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have no legends and fool&#8217;s tricks,&#8221; exclaimed
the Baron. &#8220;She shall be locked in her
room to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if she can help it,&#8221; thought Miss Elaine.
Her father had imprudently spoken too loud.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twere a wise precaution,&#8221; murmured Father
Anselm. &#8220;What are all the vintages of this
earth by the side of a loving daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so, quite so!&#8221; Sir Godfrey assented.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think,&#8221; he added, wistfully, &#8220;that
another Crusade may come along soon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my son, who can say? Tribulation is
our meted heritage. Were thy thoughts more
high, the going of thy liquors would not cause
thee such sorrow. Learn to enjoy the pure cold
water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-afternoon,&#8221; said the Baron.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>When all the guests had departed and the door
was shut safe behind them, the Father and his
holy companions broke into loud mirth. &#8220;The
Malvoisie is drunk up,&#8221; said they; &#8220;to-night
we&#8217;ll pay his lordship&#8217;s cellars another visit.&#8221;</p>

course among dangerous
rocks and rapids and

in the breast of the
helmsman a calm content
with himself, for which no man will blame
him. What in this world is there so lifts one
into complacency as the doing of a bold and
cool-headed thing? Let the helmsman sleep
sound when he has got to land! But if his
content overtake him still on the water, so that
he grows blind to the treacherous currents that
eddy where all looks placid to the careless eye,
let him beware!</p>

<p>Sir Francis came in front of the cage where
sat young Geoffrey inside, on the floor. The
knight had put his head down between his knees,
and seemed doleful enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; thought Sir Francis, giving the motionless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
figure a dark look, &#8220;my hawk is moulting.
We need scarcely put a hood on such a
tersel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next he looked at the shut door of the closet,
and a shaft of alarm shot through him to see the
keys hanging for anybody to make use of them
that pleased. He thought of Elaine, and her
leaving the table without his seeing her go.
What if she had paid this room a visit?</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps that bird with head under wing in
there,&#8221; he mused, looking once more at Geoffrey,
&#8220;is not the simple-witted nestling he looks. My
son!&#8221; he called.</p>
</div>

<p>But the youth did not care to talk, and so
showed no sign.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son, peace be with you!&#8221; repeated Father
Anselm, coming to the bars and wearing a benevolent
mien.</p>

<p>Geoffrey remained quite still.</p>

<p>&#8220;If repentance for thy presumption hath visited
thee&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; went on the Father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hypocrite!&#8221; was the word that jumped to the
youth&#8217;s lips; but fortunately he stopped in time,
and only moved his legs with some impatience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I perceive with pain, my son,&#8221; said Father
Anselm, &#8220;that repentance hath not yet visited
thee. Well, &#8217;twill come. And that&#8217;s a blessing
too,&#8221; he added, sighing very piously.</p>

<p>&#8220;He plays a part pretty well,&#8221; thought Geoffrey
as he listened. &#8220;So will I.&#8221; Then he
raised his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long am I to stay in this place?&#8221; he
inquired, taking a tone of sullen humour, such
as he thought would fit a prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly until thy present unbridled state
of sin is purged out of thee,&#8221; replied the Father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under such a dose as thou art,&#8221; Geoffrey
remarked, &#8220;that will be soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is vain talk, my son,&#8221; said the Abbot.
&#8220;Were I of the children of this world, my
righteous indignation&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;would light on thee heavily. But we
who have renounced the world and its rottenness&#8221;
(here his voice fell into a manner of
chanting) &#8220;make a holiday of forgiving injuries,
and find a pleasure even in pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Open this door then,&#8221; Geoffrey answered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll provide thee with a whole week of
joy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said Father Anselm, &#8220;I had never
gathered from thy face that thou wert such a
knave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least in the matter of countenances I have
the advantage of thee,&#8221; the youth observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I perceive,&#8221; continued the Father, &#8220;that I
must instruct thy spirit in many things,&mdash;submission,
among others. Therefore thou shalt
bide with us for a month or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I&#8217;ll not!&#8221; shouted Geoffrey, forgetting
his r&ocirc;le of prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;She cannot unlock thee,&#8221; Father Anselm
said, with much art slipping Elaine into the discourse.</p>

<p>Geoffrey glared at the Abbot, who now hoped
to lay a trap for him by means of his temper.
So he went further in the same direction. &#8220;Her
words are vainer than most women&#8217;s,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;though a lover would trust in them, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>The knight swelled in his rage, and might have
made I know not what unsafe rejoinder; but the
cords that Elaine had wound about him naturally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
tightened as he puffed out, and seemed by their
pressure to check his speech and bid him be wary.
So he changed his note, and said haughtily, &#8220;Because
thy cowl and thy gown shield thee, presume
not to speak of one whose cause I took up
in thy presence, and who is as high above thee in
truth as she is in every other quality and virtue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This callow talk, my son,&#8221; said the Abbot
quietly, &#8220;wearies me much. Lay thee down and
sleep thy sulks off, if thou art able.&#8221; Upon this,
he turned away to the closet where hung the
brass keys, and opened the door a-crack. He
saw the hide of the crocodile leaning against it,
and the overturned cups. &#8220;Just as that boy
Hubert packed them,&#8221; he thought to himself in
satisfaction; &#8220;no one has been prying here. I
flatter myself upon a skilful morning&#8217;s work.
I have knocked the legend out of the Baron&#8217;s
head. He&#8217;ll see to it the girl keeps away. And
as for yon impudent witling in the cage, we shall
transport him beyond the seas, if convenient; if
not, a knife in his gullet will make him forget the
Dragon of Wantley. Truly, I am master of the
situation!&#8221; And as his self-esteem grew, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Grand Marshal rubbed his hands, and went out
of the hall, too much pleased with himself to
notice certain little drops of wine dotted here
and there close by the closet, and not yet quite
dry, which, had his eye fallen upon them, might
have set him a-thinking.</p>

<p>So Geoffrey was left in his prison to whatever
comfort meditation might bring him; and the
monks of Oyster-le-Main took off their gowns,
and made themselves ready for another visit to
the wine-cellars of Wantley Manor.</p>

<p>The day before Christmas came bleakly to its
end over dingle and fen, and the last gray light
died away. Yet still you could hear the hissing
snow beat down through the bramble-thorn and
the dry leaves. After evening was altogether
set in, Hubert brought the knight a supper that
was not a meal a hungry man might be over joyful
at seeing; yet had Hubert (in a sort of fellowship
towards one who seemed scarcely longer
seasoned in manhood than himself, and whom he
had seen blacken eyes in a very valiant manner)
secretly prepared much better food than had been
directed by his worship the Abbot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The prisoner feigned sleep, and started up at
the rattle which the plate made as it was set
down under his bars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it morning?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Morning, forsooth!&#8221; Hubert answered.
&#8220;Three more hours, and we reach only midnight.&#8221;
And both young men (for different
reasons) wished in their hearts it were later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou speakest somewhat curtly for a friar,&#8221;
said Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, I am but a novice, brother,&#8221; whined
the minstrel, &#8220;and fall easily back into my ancient
and godless syntax. There is food. Pax vobiscum,
son of the flesh.&#8221; Then Hubert went over
to the closet, and very quietly unlocking the
door removed the crocodile and the various other
implements that were necessary in bringing into
being the dread Dragon of Wantley. He carried
them away to a remote quarter of the Monastery,
where the Guild began preparations that should
terrify any superstitious witness of their journey
to get the Baron&#8217;s wine. Geoffrey, solitary and
watchful in his chilly cage, knew what work must
be going on, and waited his time in patience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">

</div>

<p>At supper over at
Wantley there was but
slight inclination to
polite banter. Only
the family Chaplain,
mindful that this was
Christmas Eve, attempted
to make a
little small talk with
Sir Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christmas,&#8221; he observed
to the Baron,
&#8220;is undoubtedly coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the Baron did
not appear to have any rejoinder to this, the
young divine continued, pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though indeed,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we might make
this assertion upon any day of the three hundred
and sixty-five, and (I think) remain accurate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The celery,&#8221; growled the Baron, looking into
his plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; cried the Chaplain, cheerily. He
had failed to catch the remark. &#8220;Though of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
course everything does depend on one&#8217;s point of
view, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That celery, Whelpdale!&#8221; roared Sir Godfrey.</p>

<p>The terrified Buttons immediately dropped a
large venison pasty into Mrs. Mistletoe&#8217;s lap.
She, having been somewhat tried of late, began
screeching. Whelpdale caught up the celery,
and blindly rushed towards Sir Godfrey, while
Popham, foreseeing trouble, rapidly ascended the
sideboard. The Baron stepped out of Whelpdale&#8217;s
path, and as he passed by administered so
much additional speed that little Buttons flew
under the curtained archway and down many
painful steps into the scullery, and was not seen
again during that evening.</p>

<p>When Sir Godfrey had reseated himself, it
seemed to the Rev. Hucbald (such was the
Chaplain&#8217;s name) that the late interruption might
be well smoothed over by conversation. So he
again addressed the Baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; said he, taking a manner of
sleek clerical pleasantry, &#8220;though we can so
often say &#8216;Christmas is coming,&#8217; I suppose that if
at some suitable hour to-morrow afternoon I said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to you, &#8216;Christmas is going,&#8217; you would grant it
to be a not inaccurate remark?&#8221; The Baron ate
his dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; pursued the Rev. Hucbald.
&#8220;Yes. And by the way, I notice with pleasure
that this snow, which falls so continually, makes
the event of a green Christmas most improbable.
Indeed,&mdash;of course the proverb is familiar to
you?&mdash;the graveyards should certainly not be fat
this season. I like a lean graveyard,&#8221; smiled the
Rev. Hucbald.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate a &mdash;&mdash; fool!&#8221; exclaimed Sir Godfrey,
angrily.</p>

<p>After this the family fell into silence. Sir Godfrey
munched his food, brooding gloomily over
his plundered wine-cellar; Mrs. Mistletoe allowed
fancy to picture herself wedded to Father
Anselm, if only he had not been a religious
person; and Elaine&#8217;s thoughts were hovering
over the young man who sat in a cage till time
came for him to steal out and come to her. But
the young lady was wonderfully wise, nevertheless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa,&#8221; she said, as they left the banquet-hall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
&#8220;if it is about me you&#8217;re thinking, do not be
anxious any more at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well; what&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221; said the
Baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa, dear,&#8221; began Elaine, winsomely pulling
at a tassel on his dining-coat, &#8220;do you know,
I&#8217;ve been thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think some more, then,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;It will
come easier when you&#8217;re less new at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, papa! just when I&#8217;ve come to say&mdash;when
I want&mdash;when you&mdash;it&#8217;s very hard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
and here the artful minx could proceed no further,
but turned a pair of shining eyes at him,
and then looked the other way, blinking rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, good Lord!&#8221; muttered Sir Godfrey, staring
hard at the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa&mdash;it&#8217;s about the Dragon&mdash;and I&#8217;ve been
wrong. Very wrong. Yes; I know I have. I
was foolish.&#8221; She was silent again. Was she
going to cry, after all? The Baron shot a nervous
glance at her from the corner of his eye.
Then he said, &#8220;Hum!&#8221; He hoped very fervently
there were to be no tears. He desired to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
remain in a rage, and lock his daughter up, and
not put anything into her stocking this Christmas
Eve; and here she was, threatening to be sorry
for the past, and good for the future, and everything
a parent could wish. Never mind. You
can&#8217;t expect to get off as easily as all that. She
had been very outrageous. Now he would be
dignified and firm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I should obey Father Anselm,&#8221; she
continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should obey me,&#8221; said Sir Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I do hope another Crusade will come
soon. Don&#8217;t you think they might have one,
papa? How happy I shall be when your wine
is safe from that horrid Dragon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak of that monster!&#8221; shouted the
Baron, forgetting all about firmness and dignity.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t dare to allude to the reptile in my presence.
Look here!&#8221; He seized up a great jug
labelled &#8220;Ch&acirc;teau Lafitte,&#8221; and turned it upside
down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s empty!&#8221; said Elaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; snorted the Baron; &#8220;empty indeed.&#8221;
Then he set the jug down wrong side up, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
remained glaring at it fixedly, while his chest rose
and fell in deep heavings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind it so much, papa,&#8221; said Elaine,
coming up to him. &#8220;This very next season will
Mistletoe and I brew a double quantity of cowslip
wine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brrrrooo!&#8221; went Sir Godfrey, with a shiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll have another Crusade
soon; and then my brother Roland can go, and
the Drag&mdash; and the curse will be removed. Of
course, I know that is the only way to get rid of
it, if Father Anselm said so. I was very foolish
and wrong. Indeed I was,&#8221; said she, and looked
up in his face with eyes where shone such dear,
good, sweet, innocent, daughterly affection, that
nobody in the wide world could have suspected
she was thinking as hard as she could think, &#8220;If
only he won&#8217;t lock me up! if only he won&#8217;t! But,
oh, it&#8217;s dreadful in me to be deceiving him so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there!&#8221; said the Baron, and cleared
his throat. Then he kissed her. Where were
firmness and dignity now?</p>

<p>He let her push him into the chimney-corner,
and down into a seat; and then what did this sly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
shocking girl do but sit on his knee and tell him
nobody ever had such a papa before, and she
could never possibly love any one half so much
as she loved him, and weren&#8217;t he and she going
to have a merry Christmas to-morrow?</p>

<p>&#8220;How about that pretty young man? Hey?
What?&#8221; said Sir Godfrey, in high good-humour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; snapped Elaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think this girl knows,&#8221; he answered, adopting
a roguish countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose you mean that little fellow
this morning. Pooh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! ho!&#8221; said her father. &#8220;Ho! ho!
Little fellow! He was a pretty large fellow in
somebody&#8217;s eyes, I thought. What are you so
red about? Ho! ho!&#8221; and the Baron popped
his own eyes at her with vast relish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, papa,&#8221; said Miss Elaine, rising from
his knee, with much coldness, &#8220;I hardly understand
you, I think. If you find it amusing (and
you seem to) to pretend that I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she said no
more, but gave a slight and admirable toss of
the head. &#8220;And now I am very sleepy,&#8221; she
added. &#8220;What hour is it?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey took out his grandfather&#8217;s sun-dial,
and held it to the lamp. &#8220;Bless my soul,&#8221;
he exclaimed; &#8220;it&#8217;s twenty-two o&#8217;clock.&#8221; (That&#8217;s
ten at night nowadays, young people, and much
too late for you to be down-stairs, any of you.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Get to your bed at once,&#8221; continued Sir
Godfrey, &#8220;or you&#8217;ll never be dressed in time for
Chapel on Christmas morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Elaine went to her room, and took off her
clothes, and hung up her stocking at the foot of
the bed. Did she go to sleep? Not she. She
laid with eyes and ears wide open. And now
alone here in the dark, where she had nothing
to do but wait, she found her heart beating in
answer to her anxious and expectant thoughts.
She heard the wind come blustering from far off
across the silent country. Then a snore from
Mistletoe in the next room made her jump.
Twice a bar of moonlight fell along the floor,
wavering and weak, then sank out, and the pat
of the snow-flakes began again. After a while
came a step through the halls to her door, and
stopped. She could scarcely listen, so hard she
was breathing. Was her father going to turn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the key in her door, after
all? No such thought was
any longer in his mind.
She shut her eyes quickly
as he entered. His candle
shone upon her quiet head,
that was nearly buried out of sight; then laughter
shook him to see the stocking, and he went
softly out. He had put on his bed-room slippers;
but, as he intended to make a visit to the
cellar before retiring, it seemed a prudent thing
to wear his steel breast-plate; and over this he
had slipped his quilted red silk dressing-gown,
for it was a very cold night.</p>

<div class="backleft" style="background-image: url(images/illo_png130.jpg); height: 100%;"><a name="geoffreydragon" id="geoffreydragon"></a>

<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:400px; height:130px;"> </div>
<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:160px; height:155px;"> </div>

<p>Was there a sound away off somewhere out-of-doors?
No. He descended heavily through
the sleeping house. When the candle burned
upright and clear yellow, his gait was steady; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
he started many times at corners where its flame
bobbed and flattened and shrunk to a blue, sickly
rag half torn from the wick. &#8220;Ouf! Mort d&#8217;aieul!&#8221;
he would mutter. &#8220;But I must count my wine
to-night.&#8221; And so he came down into the wide
cellars, and trod tiptoe among the big round tuns.
With a wooden mallet he tapped them, and
shook his head to hear the hollow humming that
their emptiness gave forth. No oath came from
him at all, for the matter was too grievous. The
darkness that filled everywhere save just next to
the candle, pressed harder and harder upon him.
He looked at the door which led from inside
here out into the night, and it was comfortable to
know how thick were the panels and how stout
the bolts and hinges.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hold my own against any man, and
have jousted fairly in my time,&#8221; he thought to
himself, and touched his sword. &#8220;But&mdash;um!&#8221;
The notion of meeting a fiery dragon in combat
spoke loudly to the better part of his valour.
Suddenly a great rat crossed his foot. Ice and
fire went from his stomach all through him, and
he sprang on a wooden stool, and then found he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
was shaking. Soon he got down, with sweaty
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I getting a coward?&#8221; he asked aloud.
He seized the mallet that had fallen, and struck
a good knock against the nearest hogshead. Ah&mdash;ha!
This one, at least, was full. He twisted
the wooden stop and drank what came, from
the hollow of his hand. It was cowslip wine.
Ragingly he spluttered and gulped, and then
kicked the bins with all his might. While he
was stooping to rub his toe, who should march
in but Miss Elaine, dressed and ready for young
Geoffrey. But she caught sight of her father in
time, and stepped back into the passage in a
flutter. Good heavens! This would never do.
Geoffrey might be knocking at the cellar-door at
any moment. Her papa must be got away at
once.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Papa! papa!&#8221; she cried, running in.</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey sprang into the air, throwing mallet
and candle against the wine-butts. Then he
saw it was only his daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wretched girl! you&mdash;you&mdash;if you don&#8217;t want
to become an orphan, never tamper like that with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
my nerves again in your life. What are you
come here for? How dare you leave your bed
at such an hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mercy forgive us!&#8221; whimpered a new
voice.</p>

<p>There was Mistletoe at the door of the passage,
a candle lifted high above her head and wobbling,
so that it shook the grease all over her night-cap.
With the other hand she clutched her camisole,
while beneath a yellow flannel petticoat her fat
feet were rocking in the raw-wool foot-mittens
she wore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear: oh, Sir Godfrey! Oh, me!&#8221; said
she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saint Charity! What do you want? Holy
Ragbag, what&#8217;s the matter? Is everybody in
my house going stark mad?&#8221; Here the Baron
fell over the stool in the dark. &#8220;Give me my
candle!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Light my candle! What
business have either of you to come here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, it&#8217;s Miss Elaine I came for. Oh,
me! I&#8217;ll catch my death of cold. Her door
shutting waked me up-stairs. Oh, dear! Where
are we coming to?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You old mattrass!&#8221; said Sir Godfrey. Then
he turned to his daughter. But this young lady
had had a little time to gather her thoughts in.
So she cut short all awkward questionings with
excellent promptness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa!&#8221; she began, breathlessly. &#8220;There!
I heard it again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heard it? What?&#8221; cried the Baron, his
eyes starting.</p>

<p>&#8220;It waked me up-stairs, and I ran to get you
in your room, and you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&mdash;it? What&#8217;s it? What waked you?&#8221;
broke in Sir Godfrey, his voice rising to a shriek.</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is again!&#8221; exclaimed Elaine, clasping
her hands. &#8220;He&#8217;s coming! I hear him.
The Dragon! Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>With this, she pretended to rush for the passage,
where the squeaks of Mistletoe could be
heard already growing distant in the house.
Away bolted Sir Godfrey after her, shouting to
Elaine in terror undisguised, &#8220;Lock your door!
Lock your door!&#8221; as he fled up-stairs.</p>

<p>So there stood Miss Elaine alone, with the
coast clear, and no danger from these two courageous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
guardians. Then came a knock from
outside, and her heart bounded as she ran
through the cellar and undid the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;You darling!&#8221; said Geoffrey, jumping in with
legs all covered with snow. He left the door
open wide, and had taken four or five kisses at
the least before she could stop him. &#8220;The moon
was out for a while,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;and the
snow stopped. So I came a long way round-about,
that my tracks should not be seen. That&#8217;s
good strategy.&#8221;</p>

<p>But this strange young lady said no word, and
looked at him as if she were going to cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter, dear?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Geoffrey! I have been deceiving papa so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! It&#8217;s not to be thought of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t help thinking. I never supposed
I could do so. And it comes so terribly easy.
And I&#8217;m not a bit clever when I&#8217;m good. And&mdash;oh!&#8221;
She covered her face and turned away
from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff and nonsense!&#8221; Geoffrey broke out.
&#8220;Do be reasonable. Here is a dragon. Isn&#8217;t
there?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And everybody wants to get rid of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s robbing your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re acting for your father&#8217;s good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Geoffrey, all your talking doesn&#8217;t hide
the badness in the least bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent again; then suddenly seemed
greatly relieved. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;Papa locked me up for a whole week, when all
I wanted was to help him and everybody get rid
of the Dragon. And I am too old to be treated
so. And now I am just going to pretend there&#8217;s
a dragon when there&#8217;s not. Oh, what&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>This time it was no sham. Faint and far from
the direction of Oyster-le-Main came the roar of
the Dragon of Wantley over fields and farms.</p>

Elaine, and he dragged
out his sword.</p>

<p>But she stared at him,
and nothing further.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or no. Stay here and see me kill him,&#8221; the
boy added, pridefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kill him!&#8221; said she, in amazement. &#8220;Do
you suppose that papa, with all his experience,
couldn&#8217;t tell it was an imitation dragon? And
you talk of strategy! I have thought much
about to-night,&mdash;and, Geoffrey, you must do just

Promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll hear first what your wisdom is,&#8221;
said he, shaking his head like the sage youth that
he was.</p>

Now, sir, you must go over yonder within those
trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There where the snow has dipped the
branches low down. And leave me alone in the
cellar with the Dragon.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;With the Dragon? Alone? I did not know
you counted me a lunatic,&#8221; replied Geoffrey.
Then, after a look over the fields where the
storm was swirling, he gave attention to the
point of his sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your promise?&#8221; said she. &#8220;Will
you break your word so soon?&#8221;</p>

<p>A big gust of wind flung the snow sharp
against their faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you expect&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began the young
knight, and then said some words that I suppose
gentlemen in those old times were more prone
to use before ladies than they are to-day. Which
shows the optimists are right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, still distant, but not so distant, came
another roar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Geoffrey!&#8221; Elaine said, laying a hand upon
his arm; &#8220;indeed, you must hear me now, and
make no delay with contrary notions. There is
no danger for me. Look. He will first be by
himself to clear the way of watchers. No one
peeps out of windows when the Dragon&#8217;s howling.
Next, the rest will come and all go into
papa&#8217;s cellar for the wine. But we must get
these others away, and that&#8217;s for you.&#8221; She
paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well? Well?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will go thus: the passage shall hide me,
and the door of it be shut. You&#8217;ll watch over
by the trees, and when you see all have come
inside here, make some sort of noise at the edge
of the wood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of noise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&mdash;not as if you suspected. Seem to be
passing by. Play you are a villager going home
late. When they hear that, they&#8217;ll run away for
fear of their secret. The Dragon will surely stay
behind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why will he stay behind? Why will they
run away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Geoffrey, don&#8217;t you see that if these
men were to be seen in company with the
Dragon by one who till now knew them as
monks, where would their living be gone to?
Of course, they will get themselves out of sight,
and the Dragon will remain as a sort of human
scarecrow. Then I&#8217;ll come out from the passage-door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One would almost think you desired that
villain to kill you,&#8221; said Geoffrey. &#8220;No, indeed.
I&#8217;ll not consent to that part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How shall he kill me here?&#8221; Elaine replied.
&#8220;Do you not see the Dragon of Wantley would
have to carry a maiden away? He would not
dare to put me to the sword. When I come, I
shall speak three words to him. Before there is
time for him to think what to do, you will hear
me say (for you must have now run up from the
wood) &#8216;the legend has come true!&#8217; Then, when
I tell him that, do you walk in ready with your
sword to keep him polite. Oh, indeed,&#8221; said the
lady, with her eyes sparkling on Geoffrey, &#8220;we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
must keep his manners good for him. For I
think he&#8217;s one of those persons who might turn
out very rude in a trying situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this was far from pleasing to young Geoffrey.
But Elaine showed him how no other way
was to be found by which Sir Francis could be
trapped red-handed and distant from help. While
the knight was bending his brows down with trying
to set his thoughts into some order that
should work out a better device, a glare shone
over the next hill against the falling flakes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; said Elaine.</p>

<p>She withdrew into the cellar on the instant,
and the great door closed between them. Geoffrey
stood looking at it very anxiously, and then
walked backwards, keeping close to the walls,
and so round the tower and into the court,
whence he turned and ploughed as fast as he
could through the deep drifts till he was inside
the trees. &#8220;If they spy my steps,&#8221; he thought,
&#8220;it will seem as though some one of the house
had gone in there to secure the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the glare flashed against the
swiftly-descending curtains of the storm. Slowly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
it approached, sometimes illuminating a tree-trunk
for a moment, then suddenly gleaming on
the white mounds where rocks lay deeply cloaked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is pretty slow,&#8221; said Geoffrey, shifting
the leg he was leaning on.</p>

<div class="backleft" style="background-image: url(images/illo_png144.jpg); height: 100%;"><a name="thirst" id="thirst"></a>

<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:342px; height:100px;"> </div>
<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:220px; height:180px;"> </div>

<p>A black mass moved into sight, and from it
came spoutings of fire that showed dark, jagged
wings heavily flapping. It walked a little and
stopped; then walked again. Geoffrey could
see a great snout and head rocking and turning.
Dismal and unspeakable sounds proceeded
from the creature as it made towards the cellar-door.
After it had got close and leaned against
the panels in a toppling, swaying fashion, came a
noise of creaking and fumbling, and then the
door rolled aside upon its hinges. Next, the
blurred white ridge towards Oyster-le-Main was
darkened with moving specks that came steadily
near; and man by man of the Guild reached
the open door crouching, whispered a word or
two, and crept inside. They made no sound
that could be heard above the hissing of the
downward flakes and the wind that moaned
always, but louder sometimes. Only Elaine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
with her ear to
the cold iron
key-hole of the
passage-door,
could mark the
clink of armour,
and shivered as
she stood in the
dark. And now the cellar is full,&mdash;but not of
gray gowns. The candle flames show little glistening
sparks in the black coats of mail, and
the sight of themselves cased in steel, and each
bearing an empty keg, stirred a laughter among
them. Then the kegs were set down without
noise on the earthy floor among the bins. The
Dragon was standing on his crooked scaly hind-legs;
and to see the grim, changeless jaw and
eyes brought a dead feeling around the heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
But the two bungling fore-paws moved upwards,
shaking like a machine, and out of a slit in the
hide came two white hands that lifted to one side
the brown knarled mask of the crocodile. There
was the black head of Sir Francis Almoign.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis hot in there,&#8221; he said; and with two fingers
he slung the drops of sweat from his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wet thy whistle before we begin,&#8221; said Hubert,
filling a jug for him. Sir Francis took it in
both hands, and then clutched it tightly as a
sudden singing was set up out in the night.</p>
</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&#8220;Come, take a wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come, take a wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere thou learnest age&#8217;s treasons!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The tune came clear and jolly, cutting through
the muffled noises of the tempest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blood and death!&#8221; muttered Hubert.</p>

<p>Each figure had sprung into a stiff position of
listening.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&#8220;Quit thy roving;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shalt by loving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not wax lean in stormy seasons.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ho! ho! oh,&mdash;ho!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not wax lean in&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Here the strain snapped off short. Then a
whining voice said, &#8220;Oh, I have fallen again! A
curse on these roots. Lucifer fell only once, and
&#8217;twas enough for him. I have looked on the
wine when it was red, and my dame Jeanie will
know it soon, oh, soon! But my sober curse on
these roots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; said Hubert. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
band of Christmas singers has strolled into these
parts to chant carols. One of them has stopped
too long at the tavern.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I see a light?&#8221; said the voice. &#8220;Help!
Give me a light, and let me go home.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&#8220;Quit thy roving;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shalt by loving&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Shall I open his throat, that he may sing the
next verse in heaven?&#8221; Hubert inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, fool!&#8221; said Sir Francis. &#8220;Who knows
if his brother sots are not behind him to wake
the house? This is too dangerous to-night.
Away with you, every one. Stoop low till ye
are well among the fields, and then to Oyster-le-Main!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
I&#8217;ll be Dragon for a while, and follow
after.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly catching up his keg, each man left the
cellar like a shadow. Geoffrey, from the edge
of the wood, saw them come out and dissolve
away into the night. With the tube of the torch
at his lips, Sir Francis blew a blast of fire out at
the door, then covered his head once more with
the grinning crocodile. He roared twice, and
heard something creak behind him, so turned to
see what had made it. There was Miss Elaine
on the passage-steps. Her lips moved to speak,
but for a short instant fear put a silence upon
her that she found no voice to break. He, with
a notion she was there for the sake of the legend,
waved his great paws and trundled towards
where she was standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not forget to roar, sir,&#8221; said the young
lady, managing her voice so there was scarce any
tremble to be heard in it.</p>

<p>At this the Dragon stood still.</p>

<p>&#8220;You perceive,&#8221; she said to him, &#8220;after all, a
dragon, like a mouse, comes to the trap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite yet,&#8221; cried Sir Francis, in a terrible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
voice, and rushed upon her, meaning
death.</p>

<p>&#8220;The legend has come true!&#8221; she loudly
said.</p>

<p>A gleaming shaft of steel whistled across the
sight of Sir Francis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt there!&#8221; thundered Geoffrey, leaping
between the two, and posing his sword for a
lunge.</p>

<p>&#8220;My hour has come,&#8221; Sir Francis thought.
For he was cased in the stiff hide, and could do
nothing in defence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now shalt thou lick the earth with thy lying
tongue,&#8221; said Geoffrey.</p>

<p>A sneer came through the gaping teeth of the
crocodile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Valiant, indeed!&#8221; the voice said. &#8220;Very
valiant and knightly, oh son of Bertram of Poictiers!
Frenchmen know when to be bold. Ha!
ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crawl out of that nut, thou maggot,&#8221; answered
Geoffrey, &#8220;and taste thy doom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here was a chance, the gift of a fool. The
two white hands appeared and shifted the mask<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
aside, letting them see a cunning hope on his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not go further, sir,&#8221; said Elaine. &#8220;It is
for the good of us all that you abide where you
are. As I shall explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this, Elaine?&#8221; said Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your promise!&#8221; she answered, lifting a finger
at him.</p>

<p>There was a dry crack from the crocodile&#8217;s hide.</p>

<p>&#8220;Villain!&#8221; cried Geoffrey, seizing the half-extricated
body by the throat. &#8220;Thy false skin
is honester than thyself, and warned us. Back
inside!&#8221;</p>

<p>The robber&#8217;s eyes shrivelled to the size of a
snake&#8217;s, as, with no tenderness, the youth grappled
with him still entangled, and with hands,
feet, and knees drove him into his shell as a
hasty traveller tramples his effects into a packing-case.</p>

<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; said Elaine, &#8220;how pleasantly we two
have you at our disposal. Shall the neighbours
be called to have a sight of the Dragon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want with me?&#8221; said Sir Francis,
quietly. For he was a philosopher.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place,&#8221; answered Geoffrey, &#8220;know
that thou art caught. And if I shall spare thee
this night, it may well be they&#8217;ll set thy carcase
swinging on the gallows-tree to-morrow morning,&mdash;or,
being Christmas, the day after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see my case without thy help,&#8221; Sir
Francis replied. &#8220;What next?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, Elaine came to Geoffrey and they
whispered together.</p>

<div class="backleft" style="background-image: url(images/illo_png150.jpg); height: 100%;"><a name="entrapped" id="entrapped"></a>

<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:185px; height:220px;"> </div>
<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:392px; height:70px;"> </div>


<p>&#8220;Thy trade is done for,&#8221; said the youth, at
length. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be no more monks of Oyster-le-Main,
and no more
Dragon of Wantley.
But thou and the other
curs may live, if ye so
choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Through what do I
buy my choice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Through a further
exhibition of thine art.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Thou must play Dragon to-night once again for
the last time. This, that I may show thee captive
to Sir Godfrey Disseisin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And in chains, I think,&#8221; added Elaine.
&#8220;There is one behind the post.&#8221; It had belonged
in the bear-pit during the lives of Orlando
Crumb and Furioso Bun, two bears trapped
expressly for the Baron near Roncevaux.</p>

<p>&#8220;After which?&#8221; inquired Sir Francis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou shalt go free, and I will claim this lady&#8217;s
hand from her father, who promised her to any
man that brought the Dragon to him dead or
alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa shall be kept at a distance from you,&#8221;
said Elaine, &#8220;and will never suspect in this dimness,
if you roar at him thoroughly.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; continued Geoffrey, &#8220;I shall lead thee
away as my spoil, and the people shall see the
lizard-skin after a little while. But thou must
journey far from Wantley, and never show face
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And go from Oyster-le-Main and the
tithings?&#8221; exclaimed Sir Francis. &#8220;My house
and my sustenance?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sustain thyself elsewhere,&#8221; said Geoffrey;
&#8220;I care not how.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said Sir Francis. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not do this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we call Sir Godfrey. The Baron will
not love thee very much, seeing how well he
loves his Burgundy thou hast drank. Thou
gavest him sermons on cold spring-water. He&#8217;ll
remember that. I think thou&#8217;lt be soon hanging.
So choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Knight of the Voracious Stomach was
silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a pretty scheme thou hast,&#8221; he presently
said. &#8220;And not thine own. She has
taught thee this wit, I&#8217;ll be bound. Mated to
her, thou&#8217;lt prosper, I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, thy choice,&#8221; said Geoffrey, sternly.</p>

<p>A sour smile moved the lips of Sir Francis.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it has been good while it
lasted. Yes, I consent. Our interests lie together.
See how Necessity is the mother of
Friendship, also.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mask was drawn over his face, and they
wound the chain about the great body.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be sounds of fighting,&#8221; said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Elaine. &#8220;Make them when I am gone into the
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had strangled thee in thy prison, which
was in my mind,&#8221; said the voice of the hidden
speaker, &#8220;this folly we&mdash;but there. Let it go,
and begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they fell to making a wonderful disturbance.
The Dragon&#8217;s voice was lifted in
horrid howlings; and the young knight continually
bawled with all his lungs. They chased
as children in a game do: forward, back, and
across to nowhere, knocking the barrels, clanking
and clashing, up between the rows and around
corners; and the dry earth was ground under
their feet and swept from the floor upward in a
fine floating yellow powder that they sucked
down into their windpipes, while still they hustled
and jangled and banged and coughed and grew
dripping wet, so the dust and the water mingled
and ran black streams along their bodies from
the neck downwards, tickling their backs and
stomachs mightily. When the breath was no
longer inside them, they stopped to listen.</p>

<p>The house was stone still, and no noise came,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
save always the wind&#8217;s same cheerless blowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much more of this before they will
awaken?&#8221; exclaimed Geoffrey, in indignation.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis a scandal people should sleep so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are saying their prayers,&#8221; said Sir
Francis.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a pity thou art such a miscreant,&#8221; Geoffrey
said, heartily; &#8220;otherwise I could sweat
myself into a good-humour with thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Sir Francis replied with coldness, &#8220;It is
easy for the upper hand to laugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must at it again,&#8221; said Geoffrey; &#8220;and
this time I will let them hear thou art conquered.&#8221;
The din and hubbub recommenced. And Mistletoe
could hear it where she quaked inside her
closet holding the door with both hands. And
the Baron could hear it. He was locked in the
bath-room, dreadfully sorry he had not gone to
the Crusade. Quite unknowingly in his alarm he
had laid hold of a cord that set going the shower-bath;
but he gave no heed at all to this trifle.
And every man and woman in the house heard
the riot, from the scullion up through the cook to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Popham, who had unstrapped his calves before
retiring, so that now his lean shanks knocked
together like hockey-sticks. Little Whelpdale,
freezing in his shirt-tail under the bed, was crying
piteously upon all Saints to forget about his sins
and deliver him. Only Miss Elaine standing in
her room listened with calm; and she with not
much, being on the threshold of a chance that
might turn untoward so readily. Presently a
victorious shouting came from far down through
the dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is mine!&#8221; the voice bellowed. &#8220;I have
laid him low. The Dragon is taken.&#8221; At this
she hastened to summon Sir Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, where can he be?&#8221; she exclaimed,
stopping in astonishment at his room, empty and
the door open wide.</p>

<p>Down in the cellar the voice continued to call
on all people to come and see the Dragon of
Wantley. Also Elaine heard a splashing and
dripping that sounded in the bath-room. So she
ran to the door and knocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t come in!&#8221; said the Baron angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa! They&#8217;ve caught the Dragon. Oh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
why are you taking your bath at such a
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Taking my grandmother!&#8221; Sir Godfrey retorted
in great dudgeon. But he let the rope go,
and the shower stopped running. &#8220;Go to your
room,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I told you to lock your
door. This Dragon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s caught, papa,&#8221; cried Elaine through
the key-hole. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you hear me? Geoff&mdash;&mdash;somebody
has got him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How now?&#8221; said the Baron, unlocking the
door and peering out. &#8220;What&#8217;s all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>His dressing-gown was extremely damp, for
stray spouts from the shower-bath had squirted
over him. Fortunately, the breast-plate underneath
had kept him dry as far as it went.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hum,&#8221; he said, after he had listened to the
voice in the cellar. &#8220;This is something to be
cautious over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the people of this house do not come soon
to bear witness of my conquest,&#8221; said the voice
in tones of thunder, &#8220;I&#8217;ll lead this Dragon
through every chamber of it myself.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Damnum absque injuria!&#8221; shrieked Sir Godfrey,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and uttered much more horrible language
entirely unfit for general use. &#8220;What the Jeofailes
does the varlet mean by threatening an
Englishman in his own house? I should like to
know who lives here? I should like to know
who I am?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baron flew down the entry in a rage. He
ran to his bedside and pulled his sword from
under the pillows where he always kept it at
night with his sun-dial.<a name="noise" id="noise"></a></p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;We shall see who is master of this house,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I am not going to&mdash;does he suppose
anybody that pleases can come carting their
dragons through my premises? Get up! Get
up! Every one!&#8221; he shouted,
hurrying along the hall with the
sword in his right hand and a
lantern in his left. His slippers
were only half on, so they
made a slithering and slapping
over the floor; and his speed
was such that the quilted red
dressing-gown filled with the
wind and spread behind him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
till he looked like a huge new sort of
bird or an eccentric balloon. Up and
down in all quarters of the house went
Sir Godfrey, pounding
against every shut door.
Out they came. Mistletoe
from her closet, squeaking.
Whelpdale from
under his bed. The
Baron allowed him time
to put on a pair of
breeches wrong side out.
The cook came, and you could hear her panting
all the way down from the attic. Out came the
nine house-maids with hair in curl-papers. The
seven footmen followed. Meeson and Welsby
had forgotten their wigs. The coachman and
grooms and stable-boys came in horse-blankets
and boots. And last in the procession,
old Popham, one calf
securely strapped on, and the
other dangling disgracefully.
Breathless they huddled behind
the Baron, who strode to the cellar,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
where he flung the door open. Over in a corner
was a hideous monster, and every man fell against
his neighbour and shrieked. At which the monster
roared most alarmingly, and all fell together
again. Young Geoffrey stood in the middle of
the cellar, and said not a word. One end of a
chain was in his hand, and he waited mighty stiff
for the Baron to speak. But when he saw Miss
Elaine come stealing in after the rest so quiet
and with her eyes fixed upon him, his own eyes
shone wonderfully.</p>

<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:185px; height:228px;"> </div>

<p>At the sight of the Dragon, Sir Godfrey forgot
his late excitement, and muttered &#8220;Bless my
soul!&#8221; Then he stared at the beast for some
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&mdash;can&#8217;t he do anything?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Geoffrey shortly; &#8220;he can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not fly up at one, for instance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have broken his wing,&#8221; replied the youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;d like to look at him. Never saw one
before,&#8221; said the Baron; and he took two steps.
Then gingerly he moved another step.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care!&#8221; Geoffrey cried, with rapid
alarm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The monster moved, and from his nostrils (as
it seemed) shot a plume of flame.</p>

<p>Popham clutched the cook, and the nine house-maids
sank instantly into the arms of the seven
footmen without the slightest regard to how unsatisfactorily
nine goes into seven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; said the Baron, getting
behind a hogshead, &#8220;what a brute!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it might be useful if I excommunicated
him,&#8221; said the Rev. Hucbald, who had
come in rather late, with his clerical frock-coat
buttoned over his pyjamas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said the Baron. &#8220;As if he&#8217;d care for
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very few men can handle a dragon,&#8221; said
Geoffrey, unconcernedly, and stroked his upper
lip, where a kindly-disposed person might see
there was going to be a moustache some
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly what you mean to imply
by that, young man,&#8221; said the Baron, coming out
from behind the hogshead and puffing somewhat
pompously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, zounds!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;I left you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
locked up this afternoon, and securely. How
came you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey coughed, for it was an awkward inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer me without so much throat-clearing,&#8221;
said the Baron.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll clear my throat as it pleases me,&#8221; replied
Geoffrey hotly. &#8220;How I came here is no affair
of yours that I can see. But ask Father Anselm
himself, and he will tell you.&#8221; This was a happy
thought, and the youth threw a look at the
Dragon, who nodded slightly. &#8220;I have a question
to ask you, sir,&#8221; Geoffrey continued, taking
a tone and manner more polite. Then he
pointed to the Dragon with his sword, and was
silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Sir Godfrey, &#8220;don&#8217;t keep me
waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear your memory&#8217;s short, sir. By your
word proclaimed this morning the man who
brought you this Dragon should have your
daughter to wife if she&mdash;if she&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; said the Baron. &#8220;To be sure. Though
it was hasty. Hum! Had I foreseen the matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
would be so immediately settled&mdash;she&#8217;s a great
prize for any lad&mdash;and you&#8217;re not hurt either.
One should be hurt for such a reward. You
seem entirely sound of limb and without a
scratch. A great prize.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the Dragon,&#8221; replied Geoffrey, &#8220;and
here am I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Sir Godfrey was an honourable man.
When he once had given his word, you could
hold him to it. That is very uncommon to-day,
particularly in the matter of contracts. He
gathered his dressing-gown about him, and
looked every inch a parent. &#8220;Elaine,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, papa!&#8221; murmured that young woman in
a die-away voice.</p>

<p>Geoffrey had just time to see the look in her
brown eye as she turned her head away. And
his senses reeled blissfully, and his brain blew
out like a candle, and he ceased to be a man who
could utter speech. He stood stock-still with his
gaze fixed upon Elaine. The nine house-maids
looked at the young couple with many sympathetic
though respectful sighings, and the seven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
footmen looked comprehensively at the nine
house-maids.</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey smiled, and very kindly. &#8220;Ah,
well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;once I&mdash;but tush! You&#8217;re a
brave lad, and I knew your father well. I&#8217;ll
consent, of course. But if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll
give you rather a quick blessing this evening.
&#8217;Tis growing colder. Come here, Elaine. Come
here, sir. There! Now, I hate delay in these
matters. You shall be married to-morrow.
Hey? What? You don&#8217;t object, I suppose?
Then why did you jump? To-morrow, Christmas
Day, and every church-bell in the county
shall ring three times more than usual. Once
for the holy Feast, and may the Lord bless it
always! and once for my girl&#8217;s wedding. And
once for the death and destruction of the Dragon
of Wantley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; said the united household.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a nuptials that shall be the talk
of our grandchildren&#8217;s children, and after them.
We&#8217;ll have all the people to see. And we&#8217;ll
build the biggest pile of fagots that can be cut
from my timber, and the Dragon shall be chained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
on the top of it, and we&#8217;ll cremate him like an
Ancient,&mdash;only alive! We&#8217;ll cremate the monster
alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elaine jumped. Geoffrey jumped. The chain
round the Dragon loudly clanked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;do you not find this a pleasant plan?&#8221;
asked the Baron, surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me, sir,&#8221; stuttered Geoffrey,
beating his brains for every next word, &#8220;it seems
to me a monstrous pity to destroy this Dragon
so. He is a rare curiosity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you expect me to clap him in a box-stall
and feed him?&#8221; inquired the Baron with
scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no, sir. But since it is I who have
tracked, stalked, and taken him with the help of
no other huntsman,&#8221; said Geoffrey, &#8220;I make bold
to think the laws of sport vest the title to him in
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No such thing,&#8221; said Sir Godfrey. &#8220;You
have captured him in my cellar. I know a little
law, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The law about wild beasts in Poictiers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Geoffrey began.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;What care I for your knavish and perverted
foreign legalities over the sea?&#8221; snorted Sir
Godfrey. &#8220;This is England. And our Common
Law says you have trespassed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; said Geoffrey, &#8220;this wild beast
came into your premises after I had marked him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t dear sir me!&#8221; shouted the Baron.
&#8220;Will you hear the law for what I say? I tell
you this Dragon&#8217;s my dragon. Don&#8217;t I remember
how trespass was brought against Ralph
de Coventry, over in Warwickshire? Who did
no more than you have done. And they held
him. And there it was but a little pheasant his
hawk had chased into another&#8217;s warren&mdash;and
you&#8217;ve chased a dragon, so the offence is
greater.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if&mdash;&#8221; remonstrated the youth, &#8220;if a
fox&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fox me no foxes! Here is the case of
Ralph de Coventry,&#8221; replied Sir Godfrey, looking
learned, and seating himself on a barrel of beer.
&#8220;Ralph pleaded before the Judge saying, &#8216;et
nous lessamus nostre faucon voler &agrave; luy, et il le
pursuy en le garrein,&#8217;&mdash;&#8217;tis just your position,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
only &#8217;twas you that pursued and not your falcon,
which does not in the least distinguish the cases.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Geoffrey again, &#8220;the Dragon
started not on your premises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter for that; for you have pursued
him into my warren, that is, my cellar, my enclosed
cellar, where you had no business to be.
And the Court told Ralph no matter &#8216;que le
feisant leva hors de le garrein, vostre faucon luy
pursuy en le garrein.&#8217; So there&#8217;s good sound
English law, and none of your foppish outlandishries
in Latin,&#8221; finished the Baron, vastly delighted
at being able to display the little learning
that he had. For you see, very few gentlemen
in those benighted days knew how to speak the
beautiful language of the law so fluently as
that.</p>

<p>&#8220;And besides,&#8221; continued Sir Godfrey suddenly,
&#8220;there is a contract.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What contract?&#8221; asked Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good and valid one. When I said this
morning that I would give my daughter to the
man who brought me the Dragon alive or dead,
did I say I would give him the Dragon too? So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
choose which you will take, for both you cannot
have.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this Elaine turned pale as death, and Geoffrey
stood dumb.</p>

<p>Had anybody looked at the Dragon, it was
easy to see the beast was much agitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Choose!&#8221; said Sir Godfrey. &#8220;&#8217;Tis getting
too cold to stay here. What? You hesitate
between my daughter and a miserable reptile? I
thought the lads of France were more gallant.
Come, sir! which shall it be? The lady or the
Dragon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Geoffrey, and his blood and heart
stood still (and so did Elaine&#8217;s, and so did another
person&#8217;s), &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;think I will choose the
l&mdash;lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cheered the household once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord!&#8221; said the Dragon, but nobody
heard him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; observed Sir Godfrey. &#8220;And now
we&#8217;ll chain him in my bear-pit till morning, and
at noon he shall be burned alive by the blazing
fagots. Let us get some sleep now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cloud of slimly-clad domestics departed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
with slow steps, and many a look of fear cast
backward at the captured monster.</p>

<p>&#8220;This Dragon, sir,&#8221; said Geoffrey, wondering
at his own voice, &#8220;will die of thirst in that pit.
Bethink you how deep is his habit of drinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! I have often bethought me,&#8221; retorted
Sir Godfrey, rolling his eyes over the empty
barrels. &#8220;But here! I am a man of some heart,
I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seized up a bucket and ran to the hogshead
containing his daughter&#8217;s native cowslip
wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he observed when the bucket was
pretty well filled. &#8220;Put that in to moisten his
last hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Baron led the way round the Manor
to the court-yard where the bear-pit was. His
daughter kept pace with him not easily, for the
excellent gentleman desired to be a decent distance
away from the Dragon, whom young Geoffrey
dragged along in the rear.</p>

the bear-pit, having
some distance to go,
good-humour and benevolence
began to rise
up in the heart of Sir
Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a great thing!&#8221; he said to Miss
Elaine. &#8220;Ha! an important and joyful occurrence.
The news of it will fly far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the young lady replied, but without
enthusiasm. &#8220;The cattle will be safe now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cattle, child! my Burgundy! Think of
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The people will come,&#8221; continued the Baron,
&#8220;from all sides to-morrow&mdash;why, it&#8217;s to-morrow
now!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;From all sides they will come
to my house to see my Dragon. And I shall
permit them to see him. They shall see him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
cooked alive, if they wish. It is a very proper
curiosity. The brute had a wide reputation.&#8221;</p>

<p>To hear himself spoken of in the past tense,
as we speak of the dead, was not pleasant to Sir
Francis, walking behind Geoffrey on all fours.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall send for Father Anselm and his
monks,&#8221; the Baron went on.</p>

<p>Hearing this Geoffrey started.</p>

<p>&#8220;What need have we of them, sir?&#8221; he inquired.
To send for Father Anselm! It was
getting worse and worse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Need of Father Anselm?&#8221; repeated Sir Godfrey.
&#8220;Of course I shall need him. I want the
parson to tell me how he came to change his
mind and let you out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, to be sure,&#8221; said Geoffrey, mechanically.
His thoughts were reeling helplessly together,
with no one thing uppermost.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Not that I disapprove it. I have changed my
own mind upon occasions. But &#8217;twas sudden,
after his bundle of sagacity about Crusades and
visions of my ancestor and what not over there
in the morning. Ha! ha! These clericals are
no more consistent than another person. I&#8217;ll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
never let the Father forget this.&#8221; And the
Baron chuckled. &#8220;Besides,&#8221; he said, &#8220;&#8217;tis suitable
that these monks should be present at the
burning. This Dragon was a curse, and curses
are somewhat of a church matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Geoffrey, for lack of a better
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, bless my soul!&#8221; shouted the Baron,
suddenly wheeling round to Elaine at his side,
so that the cowslip wine splashed out of the
bucket he carried, &#8220;it&#8217;s my girl&#8217;s wedding-day
too! I had clean forgot. Bless my soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y&mdash;yes, papa,&#8221; faltered Elaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, young fellow!&#8221; her father called
out to Geoffrey with lusty heartiness. &#8220;You&#8217;re
a lucky rogue, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Geoffrey, but not gayly. He
was wondering how it felt to be going mad.
Amid his whirling thoughts burned the one longing
to hide Elaine safe in his arms and tell her it
would all come right somehow. A silence fell
on the group as they walked. Even to the
Baron, who was not a close observer, the present
reticence of these two newly-betrothed lovers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
was apparent. He looked from one to the other,
but in the face of neither could he see beaming
any of the soft transports which he considered
were traditionally appropriate to the hour.
&#8220;Umph!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;it was never like this
in my day.&#8221; Then his thoughts went back some
forty years, and his eyes mellowed from within.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll cook the Dragon first,&#8221; continued the
old gentleman, &#8220;and then, sir, you and my girl
shall be married. Ha! ha! a great day for
Wantley!&#8221; The Baron swung his bucket, and
another jet of its contents slid out. He was
growing more and more delighted with himself
and his daughter and her lover and everybody in
the world. &#8220;And you&#8217;re a stout rogue, too, sir,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Built near as well as an Englishman,
I think. And that&#8217;s an excellent thing in a husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baron continued to talk, now and then
almost falling in the snow, but not permitting
such slight mishaps to interrupt his discourse,
which was addressed to nobody and had a general
nature, touching upon dragons, marriages,
Crusades, and Burgundy. Could he have seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Geoffrey&#8217;s more and more woe-begone and distracted
expression, he would have concluded his
future son-in-law was suffering from some sudden
and momentous bodily ill.</p>

<p>The young man drew near the Dragon.
&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; he said in a whisper.
&#8220;Can I steal the keys of the pit? Can we
say the Dragon escaped?&#8221; The words came in
nervous haste, wholly unlike the bold deliberateness
with which the youth usually spoke. It was
plain he was at the end of his wits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what ails thee?&#8221; inquired Sir Francis
in a calm and unmoved voice. &#8220;This is a simple
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone was so quiet that Geoffrey stared in
amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;But yonder pit!&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are ruined!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; Sir Francis replied. &#8220;Truly
thou art a deep thinker! First a woman and
now thine enemy has to assist thy distress.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put so much hatred and scorn into his
tones that Geoffrey flamed up. &#8220;Take care!&#8221;
he muttered angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; the prisoner said, laughing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
dryly. &#8220;Draw thy sword and split our secret
open. It will be a fine wedding-day thou&#8217;lt have
then. Our way out of this is plain enough. Did
not the Baron say that Father Anselm was to be
present at the burning? He shall be present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the youth. &#8220;But how to get out
of the pit? And how can there be a dragon to
burn if thou art to be Father Anselm? And
how&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am full of pity for thy brains,&#8221; said Sir
Francis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the pit!&#8221; said the voice of Sir Godfrey.
&#8220;Bring him along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; said Sir Francis to Geoffrey. &#8220;Thou
must go to Oyster-le-Main with a message.
Darest thou go alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I dare?&#8221; retorted Geoffrey, proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well. Come to the pit when the Baron
is safe in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now they were at the iron door. Here the
ground was on a level with the bottom of the pit,
but sloped steeply up to the top of its walls
elsewhere, so that one could look down inside.
The Baron unlocked the door and entered with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
his cowslip wine, which (not being a very potent
decoction) began to be covered with threads of
ice as soon as it was set down. The night was
growing more bitter as its frosty hours wore on;
for the storm was departed, and the wind fallen
to silence, and the immense sky clean and cold
with the shivering glitter of the stars.</p>

<p>Then Geoffrey led the Dragon into the pit.
This was a rude and desolate hole, and its furniture
of that extreme simplicity common to
bear-pits in those barbarous times. From the
middle of the stone floor rose the trunk of a
tree, ragged with lopped boughs and at its top
forking into sundry limbs possible to sit among.
An iron trough was there near a heap of stale
greasy straw, and both were shapeless white
lumps beneath the snow. The chiselled and
cemented walls rose round in a circle and showed
no crevice for the nails of either man or bear to
climb by. Many times had Orlando Crumb and
Furioso Bun observed this with sadness, and now
Sir Francis observed it also. He took into his
chest a big swallow of air, and drove it out again
between his teeth with a weary hissing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I will return at once,&#8221; Geoffrey whispered as
he was leaving.</p>

<p>Then the door was shut to, and Sir Francis
heard the lock grinding as the key was turned.
Then he heard the Baron speaking to Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall take this key away,&#8221; he said; &#8220;there&#8217;s
no telling what wandering fool might let the monster
out. And now there&#8217;s but little time before
dawn. Elaine, child, go to your bed. This excitement
has plainly tired you. I cannot have
my girl look like that when she&#8217;s a bride to-day.
And you too, sir,&#8221; he added, surveying Geoffrey,
&#8220;look a trifle out of sorts. Well, I am not surprised.
A dragon is no joke. Come to my
study.&#8221; And he took Geoffrey&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; said the youth. &#8220;I cannot. I&mdash;I
must change my dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh, sir! I shall send to the tavern for
your kit. Come to my study. You are pale.
We&#8217;ll have a little something hot. Aha! Something
hot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Geoffrey began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tush!&#8221; said the Baron. &#8220;You shall help me
with the wedding invitations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<div class="backleft" style="background-image: url(images/illo_png178.jpg); height: 100%;">

<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:400px; height:120px;"> </div>
<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:90px; height:120px;"> </div>

<p>&#8220;Sir!&#8221; said Geoffrey haughtily,
&#8220;I know nothing of writing and
such low habits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why no more do I, of course,&#8221;
replied Sir Godfrey; &#8220;nor would I suspect you
or any good gentleman of the practice, though
I have made my mark upon an indenture in the
presence of witnesses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man may do that with propriety,&#8221; assented
the youth. &#8220;But I cannot come with you now,
sir. &#8217;Tis not possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I say that you shall!&#8221; cried the Baron
in high good-humour. &#8220;I can mull Malvoisie famously,
and will presently do so for you. &#8217;Tis
to help me seal the invitations that I want you.
My Chaplain shall write them. Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>He locked Geoffrey&#8217;s arm in his own, and
strode quickly forward. Feeling himself dragged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
away, Geoffrey turned his head despairingly back
towards the pit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s safe enough in there,&#8221; said Sir Godfrey.
&#8220;No need to watch him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Francis had listened to this conversation
with rising dismay. And now he quickly threw
off the crocodile hide and climbed up the tree as
the bears had often done before him. It came
almost to a level with the wall&#8217;s rim, but the
radius was too great a distance for jumping.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should break my leg,&#8221; he said, and came
down the tree again, as the bears had likewise
often descended.</p>
</div>

<p>The others were now inside the house. Elaine
with a sinking heart retired to her room, and her
father after summoning the Rev. Hucbald took
Geoffrey into his study. The Chaplain followed
with a bunch of goose-quills and a large ink-horn,
and seated himself at a table, while the Baron
mixed some savoury stuff, going down his private
staircase into the buttery to get the spice and
honey necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s to the health of all, and luck to-day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>&#8221;
said the Baron; and Geoffrey would have been
quite happy if an earthquake had come and
altered all plans for the morning. Still he went
through the form of clinking goblets. But his
heart ached, and his eyes grew hot as he sat
dismal and lonely away from his girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom shall we ask to the wedding?&#8221; queried
the Rev. Hucbald, rubbing his hands and looking
at the pitcher in which Sir Godfrey had mixed
the beverage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask the whole county,&#8221; said Sir Godfrey.
&#8220;The more the merrier. My boy Roland will be
here to-morrow. He&#8217;ll find his sister has got
ahead of him. Have some,&#8221; he added, holding
the pitcher to the Rev. Hucbald.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do believe I will take just a little sip,&#8221;
returned the divine. &#8220;Thanks! ah&mdash;most delicious,
Baron! A marriage on Christmas Day,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;is&mdash;ahem!&mdash;highly irregular. But
under the unusual, indeed the truly remarkable,
circumstances, I make no doubt that the
Pope&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drat him!&#8221; said Sir Godfrey; at which the
Chaplain smiled reproachfully, and shook a long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
transparent taper finger at his patron in a very
playful manner, saying, &#8220;Baron! now, Baron!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy Roland&#8217;s learning to be a knight
over at my uncle Mortmain&#8217;s,&#8221; continued Sir Godfrey,
pouring Geoffrey another goblet. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Geoffrey&#8217;s thoughts were breeding more
anxiety in him every moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get the sealing-wax,&#8221; observed the Baron,
and went to a cabinet.</p>

<p>&#8220;This room is stifling,&#8221; cried Geoffrey. &#8220;I
shall burst soon, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my mulled Malvoisie you&#8217;re not accustomed
to,&#8221; Sir Godfrey said, as he rummaged in
the cabinet. &#8220;Open the window and get some
fresh air, my lad. Now where the deuce is my
family seal?&#8221;</p>

<p>As Geoffrey opened the window, a soft piece
of snow flew through the air and dropped lightly
on his foot. He looked quickly and perceived a
man&#8217;s shadow jutting into the moonlight from an
angle in the wall. Immediately he plunged out
through the casement, which was not very high.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merciful powers!&#8221; said the Rev. Hucbald,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
letting fall his quill and spoiling the first invitation,
&#8220;what an impulsive young man! Why,
he has run clean round the corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis all my Malvoisie,&#8221; said the Baron, hugely
delighted, and hurrying to the window. &#8220;Come
back when you&#8217;re sober!&#8221; he shouted after Geoffrey
with much mirth. Then he shut the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;These French heads never can weather English
brews,&#8221; he remarked to the Chaplain. &#8220;But
I&#8217;ll train the boy in time. He is a rare good lad.
Now, to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out in the snow, Geoffrey with his sword drawn
came upon Hubert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou mayest sheathe that knife,&#8221; said the
latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;And be thy quarry?&#8221; retorted Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come too late for that!&#8221; Hubert
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou hast been to the bear-pit, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, aye!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s big quarry there!&#8221; observed Geoffrey,
tauntingly. &#8220;Quite a royal bird.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So royal the male hawk could not bring it
down by himself, I hear,&#8221; Hubert replied. &#8220;Nay,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
there&#8217;s no use in waxing wroth, friend! My
death now would clap thee in a tighter puzzle
than thou art in already&mdash;and I should be able to
laugh down at thee from a better world,&#8221; he
added, mimicking the priestly cadence, and looking
at Geoffrey half fierce and half laughing.</p>

<p>He was but an apprentice at robbery and
violence, and in the bottom of his heart, where
some honesty still was, he liked Geoffrey well.
&#8220;Time presses,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I must go.
One thing thou must do. Let not that pit be
opened till the monks of Oyster-le-Main come
here. We shall come before noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand,&#8221; said Geoffrey.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Hubert2" id="Hubert2"></a>

</div>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s unimportant,&#8221; answered Hubert.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
&#8220;Only play thy part. &#8217;Tis a simple thing to
keep a door shut. Fail, and the whole of us
are undone. Farewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, this is some foul trick,&#8221; Geoffrey declared,
and laid his hand on Hubert.</p>

<p>But the other shook his head sadly. &#8220;Dost
suppose,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that we should have abstained
from any trick that&#8217;s known to the accumulated
wisdom of man? Our sport is up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis true,&#8221; Geoffrey said, musingly, &#8220;we hold
all of you in the hollow of one hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou canst make a present of us to the
hangman in twenty minutes if thou choosest,&#8221;
said Hubert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though &#8217;twould put me in quite as evil
case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! what&#8217;s the loss of a woman compared
with death?&#8221; Hubert exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou&#8217;lt know some day,&#8221; the young knight
said, eying Hubert with a certain pity; &#8220;that is,
if ever thou art lucky to love truly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is it so much as that?&#8221; murmured Hubert
wistfully. &#8220;&#8217;Twas good fortune for thee
and thy sweetheart I did not return to look for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
my master while he was being taken to the pit,&#8221;
he continued; &#8220;we could have stopped all your
mouths till the Day of Judgment at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldst thou have slain a girl?&#8221; asked Geoffrey,
stepping back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I, indeed! But for my master I would
not be so sure. And he says I&#8217;ll come as far as
that in time,&#8221; added the apprentice with a shade
of bitterness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art a singular villain,&#8221; said Geoffrey,
&#8220;and wonderfully frank spoken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so thou&#8217;rt to be married?&#8221; Hubert said
gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;By this next noon, if all goes well!&#8221; exclaimed
the lover with ardour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heigho!&#8221; sighed Hubert, turning to go,
&#8220;&#8217;twill be a merry Christmas for somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me thy hand,&#8221; cried Geoffrey, feeling
universally hearty.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the freebooter; &#8220;what meaning
would there be in that? I would sever thy jugular
vein in a moment if that would mend the
broken fortunes of my chief. Farewell, however.
Good luck attend thee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The eyes of both young men met, and without
unkindness in them.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am satisfied with my calling,&#8221; Hubert
asserted, repudiating some thought that he imagined
was lurking in Geoffrey&#8217;s look. &#8220;Quite
content! It&#8217;s very dull to be respectable. Look!
the dawn will discover us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this plan?&#8221; cried Geoffrey, hastening
after him; &#8220;I know nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou needest know nothing. Keep the door
of the pit shut. Farewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Geoffrey found himself watching the black
form of Hubert dwindle against the white rises
of the ground. He walked towards the tavern
in miserable uncertainty, for the brief gust of
elation had passed from his heart. Then he
returned irresolute, and looked into the pit.
There was Sir Francis, dressed in the crocodile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, come in, young fellow! Ha! ha!
how&#8217;s thy head?&#8221; The Baron was at the window,
calling out and beckoning with vigour.</p>

<p>Geoffrey returned to the study. There was no
help for it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;We have written fifty-nine already!&#8221; said the
Rev. Hucbald.</p>

<p>But the youth cast a dull eye upon the growing
heap, and sealed them very badly. What pleasure
was it to send out invitations to his own
wedding that might never be coming off?</p>

<p>As for Hubert out in the night, he walked
slowly through the wide white country. And as
he went across the cold fields and saw how the
stars were paling out, and cast long looks at the
moon setting across the smooth snow, the lad&#8217;s
eyes filled so that the moon twinkled and shot
rays askew in his sight. He thought how the
good times of Oyster-le-Main were ended, and
he thought of Miss Elaine so far beyond the
reach of such as he, and it seemed to him that he
was outside the comfortable world.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 7em; text-indent: 0em"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">ow</span> are all the people
long awake and out of
their beds. Wantley
Manor is stirring busily
in each quarter of the
house and court, and
the whole county likewise
is agog. By seven o&#8217;clock this morning it
was noised in every thatched cottage and in every
gabled hall that the great Dragon had been captured.
Some said by Saint George in person,
who appeared riding upon a miraculous white
horse and speaking a tongue that nobody could
understand, wherefore it was held to be the
language common in Paradise. Some declared
Saint George had nothing to do with it, and that
this was the pious achievement of Father Anselm.
Others were sure Miss Elaine had fulfilled the
legend and conquered the monster entirely by
herself. One or two, hearing the event had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
taken place in Sir Godfrey&#8217;s wine-cellar, said
they thought the Baron had done it,&mdash;and were
immediately set down as persons of unsound
mind. But nobody mentioned Geoffrey at all,
until the Baron&#8217;s invitations, requesting the
honour of various people&#8217;s presence at the marriage
of his daughter Elaine to that young man,
were received; and that was about ten o&#8217;clock,
the ceremony being named for twelve that day
in the family chapel. Sir Godfrey intended the
burning of the Dragon to take place not one
minute later than half-past eleven. Accordingly,
besides the invitation to the chapel, all friends
and neighbours whose position in the county or
whose intimacy with the family entitled them to
a recognition less formal and more personal, received
a second card which ran as follows: &#8220;Sir
Godfrey Disseisin at home Wednesday morning,
December the twenty-fifth, from half after eleven
until the following day. Dancing; also a Dragon
will be roasted. R.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;P.&#8221; The Disseisin
crest with its spirited motto, &#8220;Saute qui peult,&#8221;
originated by the venerable Primer Disseisin,
followed by his son Tortious Disseisin, and borne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
with so much renown in and out of a hundred
battles by a thousand subsequent Disseisins, ornamented
the top left-hand corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we shall have but few refusals,&#8221; said
the Rev. Hucbald to Sir Godfrey. &#8220;Not many
will be prevented by previous engagements, I
opine.&#8221; And the Chaplain smiled benignly, rubbing
his hands. He had published the banns of
matrimony three times in a lump before breakfast.
&#8220;Which is rather unusual,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but
under the circumstances we shall easily obtain a
dispensation.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;In providing such an entertainment for the
county as this will be,&#8221; remarked the Baron, &#8220;I
feel I have performed my duty towards society
for some time to come. No one has had a
dragon at a private house before me, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, surely not,&#8221; simpered the sleek Hucbald.
&#8220;Not even Lady Jumping Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fiddle!&#8221; grunted the Baron. &#8220;She indeed!
Fandangoes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s very pious,&#8221; protested the Rev. Hucbald,
whom the lady sometimes asked to fish
lunches in Lent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Fandangoes!&#8221; repeated the Baron. He had
once known her exceedingly well, but she pursued
variety at all expense, even his. As for
refusals, the Chaplain was quite right. There
were none. Nobody had a previous engagement&mdash;or
kept it, if they had.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious, Rupert!&#8221; (or Cecil, or Chandos,
as it might be,) each dame in the county had
exclaimed to her lord on opening the envelope
brought by private hand from Wantley, &#8220;we&#8217;re
asked to the Disseisins to see a dragon,&mdash;and his
daughter married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By heaven, Muriel, we&#8217;ll go!&#8221; the gentleman
invariably replied, under the impression that
Elaine was to marry the Dragon, which would
be a show worth seeing. The answers came
flying back to Wantley every minute or two,
most of them written in such haste that you
could only guess they were acceptances. And
those individuals who lived so far away across
the county that the invitations reached them too
late to be answered, immediately rang every bell
in the house and ordered the carriage in frantic
tones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Of <i>course</i> nobody kept any engagement. Sir
Guy Vol-au-Vent (and none but a most abandoned
desperado or advanced thinker would be
willing to do such a thing on Christmas) had
accepted an invitation to an ambush at three for
the slaying of Sir Percy de R&eacute;sistance. But the
ambush was put off till a more convenient day.
Sir Thomas de Brie had been going to spend his
Christmas at a cock-fight in the Count de Gorgonzola&#8217;s
barn. But he remarked to his man
Edward, who brought the trap to the door, that
the Count de Gorgonzola might go &mdash;&mdash; Never
mind what he remarked. It was not nice;
though oddly enough it was exactly the same
remark that the Count had made about Sir
Thomas on telling his own man James to drive
to Wantley and drop the cock-fight. All these
gentlemen, as soon as they heard the great news,
started for the Manor with the utmost speed.</p>

<div class="backleft" style="background-image: url(images/illo_png194.jpg); height: 100%;"><a name="debrie" id="debrie"></a>

<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:185px; height:260px;"> </div>

<p>Nor was it the quality alone who were so
unanimous in their feelings. The Tenantry (to
whom Sir Godfrey had extended a very hospitable
bidding to come and they should find
standing-room and good meat and beer in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
court-yard) went
nearly mad. From
every quarter of
the horizon they
came plunging and
ploughing along.
The sun blazed
down out of a sky
whence a universal
radiance seemed to
beat upon the blinding
white. Could
you have mounted up bird-fashion over the
country, you would have seen the Manor like
the centre of some great wheel, with narrow
tracks pointing in to it from the invisible rim
of a circle, paths wide and narrow, converging
at the gate, trodden across the new snow from
anywhere and everywhere; and moving along
these like ants, all the inhabitants for miles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
around. And through the wide splendour of
winter no wind blowing, but the sound of chiming
bells far and near, clear frozen drops of music in
the brittle air.</p>

<p>Old Gaffer Piers, the ploughman, stumped
along, &#8220;pretty well for eighty, thanky,&#8221; as he
somewhat snappishly answered to the neighbours
who out-walked him on the road. They would
get there first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful old man,&#8221; they said as they went
on their way, and quickly resumed their speculations
upon the Dragon&#8217;s capture. Farmer John
Stiles came driving his ox-team and snuffling, for
it was pretty cold, and his handkerchief at home.
Upon his wagon on every part, like swallows,
hung as many of his relations as could get on.
His mother, who had been Lucy Baker, and
grandmother Cecilia Kempe, and a litter of
cousin Thorpes. But his step-father Lewis Gay
and the children of the half-blood were not asked
to ride; farmer Stiles had bitterly resented the
second marriage. This family knew all the particulars
concerning the Dragon, for they had
them from the cook&#8217;s second cousin who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
courting Bridget Stiles. They knew how Saint
George had waked Father Anselm up and put
him on a white horse, and how the Abbot had
thus been able to catch the Dragon by his tail in
the air just as he was flying away with Miss
Elaine, and how at that the white horse had
turned into a young man who had been bewitched
by the Dragon, and was going to marry
Miss Elaine immediately.</p>
</div>

<p>On the front steps, shaking hands with each
person who came, was Sir Godfrey. He had
dressed himself excellently for the occasion;
something between a heavy father and an old
beau, with a beautiful part down the back of his
head where the hair was. Geoffrey stood beside
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son-in-law that&#8217;s to be,&#8221; Sir Godfrey
would say. And the gentry welcomed the young
man, while the tenants bobbed him respectful
salutations.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re one of us. Glad to know you,&#8221; said
Sir Thomas de Brie, surveying the lad with
approval.</p>

<p>Lady Jumping Jack held his hand for a vanishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
moment you could hardly make sure of. &#8220;I
had made up my mind to hate you for robbing
me of my dearest girl,&#8221; she said, smiling gayly,
and fixing him with her odd-looking eyes. &#8220;But
I see we&#8217;re to be friends.&#8221; Then she murmured
a choice nothing to the Baron, who snarled
politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let her play you,&#8221; said he to Geoffrey
when the lady had moved on. And he tapped
the youth&#8217;s shoulder familiarly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve been through all that sort of thing
over in Poictiers,&#8221; Geoffrey answered with indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a rogue, sir, as I&#8217;ve told you before.
Ha! Uncle Mortmain, how d&#8217;ye do? Yes, this
is Geoffrey. Where&#8217;s my boy Roland? Coming,
is he? Well, he had better look sharp. It&#8217;s
after eleven, and I&#8217;ll wait for nobody. How d&#8217;ye
do, John Stiles? That bull you sold me &#8217;s costing
thirty shillings a year in fences. You&#8217;ll find
something ready down by those tables, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hark to that roar! The crowd jostled together
in the court-yard, for it sounded terribly
close.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The Dragon&#8217;s quite safe in the pit, good
people,&#8221; shouted Sir Godfrey. &#8220;A few more
minutes and you&#8217;ll all see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman continued welcoming the
new arrivals, chatting heartily, with a joke for
this one and a kind inquiry for the other. But
wretched Geoffrey! So the Dragon was to be
seen in a few minutes! And where were the
monks of Oyster-le-Main? Still, a bold face
must be kept. He was thankful that Elaine,
after the custom of brides, was invisible. The
youth&#8217;s left hand rested upon the hilt of his
sword; he was in rich attire, and the curly hair
that surrounded his forehead had been carefully
groomed. Half-way up the stone steps as he
stood, his blue eyes watching keenly for the
monks, he was a figure that made many a humble
nymph turn tender glances upon him. Old Piers,
the ploughman, remained beside a barrel of running
ale and drank his health all day. For he
was a wonderful old man.</p>

<p>Hither and thither the domestics scurried
swiftly, making preparations. Some were cooking
rare pasties of grouse and ptarmigan, goslings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and dough-birds; some were setting great
tables in-doors and out; and some were piling
fagots for the Dragon&#8217;s funeral pyre. Popham,
with magnificent solemnity and a pair of new
calves, gave orders to Meeson and Welsby, and
kept little Whelpdale panting for breath with
errands; while in and out, between everybody&#8217;s
legs, and over or under all obstacles, stalked the
two ravens Croak James and Croak Elizabeth, a
big white wedding-favour tied round the neck of
each. To see these grave birds, none would
have suspected how frequently they had been in
the mince-pies that morning, though Popham had
expressly ruled (in somewhat stilted language)
that they should &#8220;take nothink by their bills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Geoffrey,&#8221; said the Baron, &#8220;I think we&#8217;ll
begin. Popham, tell them to light that fire
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The guests are still coming, sir,&#8221; said Geoffrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter. It is half after eleven.&#8221; The
Baron showed his sun-dial, and there was no
doubt of it. &#8220;Here, take the keys,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and bring the monster out for us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and put on my armour,&#8221; suggested
the young man. That would take time; perhaps
the monks might arrive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the brute&#8217;s chained. You need no
armour. Nonsense!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But think of my clothes in that pit, sir,&mdash;on
my wedding-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! That&#8217;s the first sign of a Frenchman
I&#8217;ve seen in you. Take the keys, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crackle of the kindling fagots came to
Geoffrey&#8217;s ears. He saw the forty men with
chains that were to haul the Dragon into the
fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s Father Anselm yet to come,&#8221; he
protested. &#8220;Surely we wait for him.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="courtyard" id="courtyard"></a>
<img src="images/illo_png200.jpg" width="400" height="135" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait for nobody. He with his Crusades
and rubbish! Haven&#8217;t I got this Dragon, and
there&#8217;s no Crusade?&mdash;Ah, Cousin Modus, glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
you could come over. Just in time. The
sherry&#8217;s to your left. Yes, it&#8217;s a very fine day.
Yes, yes, this is Geoffrey my girl&#8217;s to marry and
all that.&mdash;What do I care about Father Anselm?&#8221;
the old gentleman resumed testily, when his
cousin Modus had shuffled off. &#8220;Come, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave the keys into Geoffrey&#8217;s unwilling
hand, and ordered silence proclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hearken, good friends!&#8221; said he, and all talk
and going to and fro ceased. The tenantry
stood down in the court-yard, a mass of motionless
russet and yellow, every face watching the
Baron. The gentry swarmed noiselessly out
upon the steps behind him, their handsome
dresses bright against the Manor walls. There
was a short pause. Old Gaffer Piers made a
slight disturbance falling over with his cup of
ale, but was quickly set on his feet by his neighbours.
The sun blazed down, and the growling
of the Dragon came from the pit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yonder noise,&#8221; pursued Sir Godfrey, &#8220;speaks
more to the point than I could. I&#8217;ll give you no
speech.&#8221; All loudly cheered at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think,&#8221; whispered the Rev. Hucbald<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
in the Baron&#8217;s ear, &#8220;that a little something
serious should be said on such an occasion? I
should like our brethren to be reminded&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fudge!&#8221; said the Baron. &#8220;For thirteen
years,&#8221; he continued, raising his voice again,
&#8220;this Dragon has been speaking for himself.
You all know and I know how that has been.
And now we are going to speak for ourselves.
And when he is on top of that fire he&#8217;ll know
how that is. Geoffrey, open the pit and get him
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was a cheer, but a short one, for
the spell of expectancy was on all. The young
man descended into the court, and the air seemed
to turn to a wavering mist as he looked up at the
Manor windows seeking to spy Elaine&#8217;s face at
one of them. Was this to be the end? Could
he kiss her one last good-by if disaster was in
store for them after all? Alas! no glimpse of
her was to be seen as he moved along, hardly
aware of his own steps, and the keys jingling
lightly as he moved. Through the crowd he
passed, and a whispering ran in his wake followed
by deeper silence than before. He reached the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
edge of the people and crossed the open space
beyond, passing the leaping blaze of the fagots,
and so drew near the iron door of the pit. The
key went slowly into the lock. All shrank with
dismay at the roar which rent the air. Geoffrey
paused with his hand gripping the key, and there
came a sound of solemn singing over the fields.</p>

<p>&#8220;The monks!&#8221; murmured a few under their
breath; and silence fell again, each listening.</p>

<p>Men&#8217;s voices it was, and their chanting rose by
one sudden step to a high note that was held for
a moment, and then sank again, mellow like the
harmony of horns in a wood. Then over the
ridge from Oyster-le-Main the length of a slow
procession began to grow. The gray gowns
hung to the earth straight with scarce any waving
as the men walked. The heavy hoods reached
over each face so there was no telling its features.
None in the court-yard spoke at all, as the brooding
figures passed in under the gateway and
proceeded to the door of the bear-pit, singing
always. Howlings that seemed born of terror
now rose from the imprisoned monster; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
many thought, &#8220;evidently the evil beast cannot
endure the sound of holy words.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elaine in her white dress now gazed from an
upper window, seeing her lover with his enemies
drawing continually closer around him.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was well for him that his death alone
would not have served to lock their secret up
again; that the white maiden in the window is
ready to speak the word and direct instant vengeance
on them and their dragon if any ill befall
that young man who stands by the iron door.</p>

<div class="backright" style="background-image: url(images/illo_png205.jpg); height: 100%;"><a name="appearance" id="appearance"></a>

<div class="sandbag-right" style="width:190px; height:490px;"> </div>
<div class="sandbag-right" style="width:500px; height:270px;"> </div>

<p>The song of the monks ended. Sir Godfrey
on the steps was wondering why Father Anselm
did not stand out from the rest of the gray people
and explain his wishes. &#8220;Though he shall not
interrupt the sport, whatever he says,&#8221; thought
the Baron, and cast on the group of holy men a
less hospitable eye than had beamed on his other
guests. Geoffrey over at the iron door, surrounded
by the motionless figures, scanned each
hood narrowly and soon met the familiar eyes of
Hubert. Hubert&#8217;s gown, he noticed, bulged out
in a manner ungainly and mysterious. &#8220;Open
the door,&#8221; whispered that youth. At once Geoffrey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
began to turn the key.
And at its grinding all held
their breath, and a quivering
silence hung over the court.
The hasty drops pattered
down from the eaves from
the snow that was melting
on the roof. Then some
strip of metal inside the lock
sprung suddenly, making a
sharp song, and ceased.
The crowd of monks pressed
closer together as the iron
door swung open.</p>


<p>What did Geoffrey see?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
None but the monks could tell. Instantly a
single roar more terrible than any burst out, and
the huge horrible black head and jaws of the
monster reared into the view of Sir Godfrey and
his guests. One instant the fearful vision in the
door-way swayed with a stiff strange movement
over the knot of monks that surrounded it, then
sank out of sight among them. There was a
sound of jerking and fierce clanking of chains,
mingled with loud chanting of pious sentences.
Then a plume of spitting flame flared upward
with a mighty roar, and the gray figures scattered
right and left. There along the ground
lay the monster, shrivelled, twisted in dismal
coils, and dead. Close beside his black body
towered Father Anselm, smoothing the folds
of his gray gown. Geoffrey was sheathing his
sword and looking at Hubert, whose dress bulged
out no longer, but fitted him as usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been vouchsafed a miracle,&#8221; said
Father Anselm quietly, to the gaping spectators.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be no burning,&#8221; said Geoffrey, pointing
to the shrunken skin. But though he spoke
so coolly, and repelled all besieging disturbance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
from the fortress of his calm visage and bearing,
as a bold and haughty youth should do, yet he
could scarcely hold his finger steady as it pointed
to the blackened carcase. Then all at once his
eyes met those of Elaine where she watched
from her window, and relief and joy rushed
through him. He stretched his arms towards
her, not caring who saw, and the look she sent
him with a smile drove all surrounding things
to an immeasurable distance away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here indeed,&#8221; Father Anselm repeated, &#8220;is
a miracle. Lo, the empty shell! The snake
hath shed his skin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is very disappointing,&#8221; said Sir Godfrey,
bewildered. &#8220;Is there no dragon to roast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The roasting,&#8221; replied the Abbot, impressively,
&#8220;is even now begun for all eternity.&#8221;
He stretched out an arm and pointed downward
through the earth. &#8220;The evil spirit has fled.
The Church hath taken this matter into her own
hands, and claims yon barren hide as a relic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&mdash;I don&#8217;t see why the Church can&#8217;t let
good sport alone,&#8221; retorted Sir Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope she&#8217;ll not take to breaking up my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
cock-fights this way,&#8221; muttered the Count de
Gorgonzola, sulkily.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Church cares nothing for such profane
frivolities,&#8221; observed Father Anselm with cold
dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;At all events, friends,&#8221; said Sir Godfrey,
cheering up, &#8220;the country is rid of the Dragon of
Wantley, and we&#8217;ve got a wedding and a breakfast
left.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just at this moment a young horseman rode
furiously into the court-yard.</p>

<p>It was Roland, Sir Godfrey&#8217;s son. &#8220;Great
news!&#8221; he began at once. &#8220;Another Crusade has
been declared&mdash;and I am going. Merry Christmas!
Where&#8217;s Elaine? Where&#8217;s the Dragon?&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Father Anselm&#8217;s quick brain seized this chance.
He and his monks should make a more stately
exit than he had planned.</p>

<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; he said in a clear voice to his monks,
&#8220;how all is coming true that was revealed to me
this night! My son,&#8221; he continued, turning to
young Roland, &#8220;thy brave resolve reached me
ere thou hadst made it. Know it has been
through thee that the Dragon has gone!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon this there was profound silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; he added solemnly, &#8220;farewell.
The monks of Oyster-le-Main go hence to the
Holy Land also, to battle for the true Faith.
Behold! we have made us ready to meet the
toil.&#8221;</p>

<p>His haughty tones ceased, and he made a
sign. The gray gowns fell to the snow, and
revealed a stalwart, fierce-looking crew in black
armour. But the Abbot kept his gray gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll stay for the wedding?&#8221; inquired Sir
Godfrey of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our duty lies to the sea. Farewell, for I
shall never see thy face again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned. Hubert gathered up the hide of
the crocodile and threw a friendly glance back at
Geoffrey. Then again raising their song, the
black band slowly marched out under the gate
and away over the snow until the ridge hid them
from sight, and only their singing could be heard
in the distant fields.</p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 2em">&#8220;Well,&#8221; exclaimed Sir Godfrey, &#8220;it&#8217;s no use
to stand staring. Now for the wedding! Mistletoe,
go up and tell Miss Elaine. Hucbald, tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the organist to pipe up his music. And as soon
as it&#8217;s over we&#8217;ll drink the bride&#8217;s health and
health to the bridegroom. &#8217;Tis a lucky thing
that between us all the Dragon is gone, for
there&#8217;s still enough of my Burgundy to last us
till midnight. Come, friends, come in, for everything
waits your pleasure!&#8221;</p>
